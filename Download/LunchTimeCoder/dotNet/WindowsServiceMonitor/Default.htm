<h2>What is this?</h2>
This is a small utility that monitors windows services running on the local machine or any maching on the local network. And notifies you via an icon in the system tray and a balloon popup telling you which services aren't running. You can also Start and Stop services from this utility.

<strong>Main Interface</strong><br />

This is a screenshot of the main window.<br />
Clicking the "Add" and "Remove" buttons allow you to add or remove services being monitored.<br />
Clicking on a service in the list will show it's state to the right of the list, and allow you to start or stop that service using the "Start" and "Stop" buttons.<br />
Clicking either of the "Minimize" or "Close" buttons on the top right of the window will minimize the app to the system tray. To close the application, just select Exit from the File menu, or right click the system tray icon and select Exit.

<table><tr><td>
<strong>System Tray Notification</strong><br />
<img src="images/Screenshot002.png" align="left" />
The system tray icon will show a red X on it when there are one or more services that aren't running.<br />
When it first sees that a services is stopped, it will show the balloon popup notifying the user what services are stopped.<br />
Double-clicking on the system tray icon will restore the main application window.

<h2>Compatibility:</h2>
This application runs as expected on both Windows XP and Windows Vista. It can also monitor services running on Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista. It however can not monitor services running on Windows NT 4.<br />
Note that you may need admin rights on Windows Vista to run this, I haven't tested it with a restricted access user account.
<br />

Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0
