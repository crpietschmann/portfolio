## Speaking Sessions

Here's a compiled list of several of the speaking sessions I've presented at user groups, conferences, and other events. These are all sessions that can be delivered in 45 minutes to 1 hour.

#### Designing a Secure IoT Solution Architecture

Cybersecurity is important in any software solution. It's even more important in the Internet of Things! This session takes you through various aspects of designing a secure IoT solution. We'll discuss aspects of IoT security architecture such as Trust Zones and Boundaries, Azure IoT Edge, and securing IoT devices connected to Azure IoT services. We will even discuss what Azure Sphere has to offer for building more highly secured IoT solutions. You'll leave this session with a better understanding of what a secure IoT solution architecture looks like and how to build one yourself.

#### Introduction to Building IoT Solutions with Microsoft Azure

Skynet is coming! The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly growing all around us. Soon we will be surrounded by internet connected devices that may be tracking us, recording us, denying us access, driving us around, keeping us alive, and even automatically ordering us toilet paper. Join this digital safari for a guided tour of IoT Architecture, Messaging, and Security, in addition to an overview of the hardware available from Raspberry Pi to Arduino. In addition to the hardware, this talk covers the spectrum of the Microsoft Azure IoT services, Service Bus, Steam Analytics, and Azure Functions. It also covers why and how to use these services to build a big data style Lambda Architecture for your IoT that will scale.

#### Implementing Real-Time IoT Stream Processing in Azure

So, you have IoT Devices connected to IoT Hub sending telemetry data into the Microsoft Azure cloud. Now what? This session will take you through setting up real-time stream processing of IoT data. We’ll look at integrating services like Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Functions, and Cosmos DB to build a highly scalable stream processing backend for any IoT solution. You’ll leave this session better prepared to handle real-time IoT stream processing in Azure; plus you’ll do it with less code by utilizing serverless Azure Functions.

#### Introduction to Building Secure IoT Solutions using Azure Sphere

Cybersecurity is important in any software solution. It’s even more important in the Internet of Things. This session takes you through building and prototyping secure, Internet to Things solutions using Azure Sphere; the Linux-based, secured, connected, crossover microcontroller unit (MCU) from Microsoft. We’ll look at securing Azure Sphere devices, writing and deploying code, and communicating with Azure IoT Hub. You’ll leave this session better prepared to build more highly secured IoT solutions using Microsoft Azure.

#### A Developers Guide to Building Highly Scalable and Available Web Apps in Azure

High scalability and high availability are much more than just deploying your app to a server. We know this with on-premises servers, and usually just add multiple server instances. But, what if your building your web application in the cloud? This session dives into the various features and services in the Microsoft Azure cloud that are built to help you build highly scalable and highly available applications that can serve users all around the globe. You will learn ways to make your applications both scalable and resilient to failure using services like Azure App Service, Traffic Manager, Azure Front Door, and more.
