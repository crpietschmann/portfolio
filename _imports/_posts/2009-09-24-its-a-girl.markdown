<p>Some of you that follow my blog may have noticed that it’s been almost a month since I’ve really posted anything. I know I’ve done this in the past when I’ve been busy working on other things (mostly to get paid), but this time it’s for an entirely different reason…</p>  <p>My wife and I had a beautiful baby girl! And, we’ve been adjusting to our new sleep schedule of only getting 2-4 hours of sleep maximum at a time. Anyone with kids understands how it is with a newborn, and now only after having one do I fully understand. After all, I was sleeping way too much before anyway.</p>  <p>Things have been going absolutely wonderful!</p>  <p>I’m still trying to figure out how I’m going to have enough time to keep on blogging and learning now that I have most of my time dedicated elsewhere. One thing I don’t want to do is completely disappear from the web, like I’ve seen other tech bloggers do after a major personal life change such as this. So, I’ll just keep on blogging here and there, and maybe I’ll still be able to improve the quality of my posts.</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
