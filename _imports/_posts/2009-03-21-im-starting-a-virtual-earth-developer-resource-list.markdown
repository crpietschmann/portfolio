<p>
I just started a page at the below link that I&#39;m lising a bunch of Virtual Earth Developer Resources that I know of. The reason I&#39;m doing this is because there just aren&#39;t any really good lists of resources out there, and there are a TON of resources that you probably don&#39;t even know about. This isn&#39;t going to be an all inclusive list (that would be impossible), but I&#39;ll try to make it the best list of resources I can. Hope it helps some of you discover great content.
