<p>It was a great night, with a really great turn out. I'm not sure the exact number of attendees, but I think it must have been over 150! A few volunteers got up and gave some great demo presentations of new features in VS'08 and .NET 3.5. There was even a 360 setup&nbsp;with Halo 3 for people&nbsp;to&nbsp;play.&nbsp;Don't forget about all the great prizes that were given away: a couple Zunes, an XBox 360 Premium, an XBox 360 Elite, and alot of other games and software.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget about all the toys that were donated, and the 360 Elite was given at random to one of the people that donated a toy. There were actually a few that donated multiple toys.</p>
