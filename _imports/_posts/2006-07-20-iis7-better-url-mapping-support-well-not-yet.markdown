<P>Recently, I search for articles/documentation about Url Mapping in IIS7, but I couldn't find anything. So, I asked <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/06/15/My-TechEd-Talk-Now-Available-for-Download.aspx#455783">Scott on his blog</A>, "What features does IIS7 offer for Url Mapping?"</P>
<P>Scott replied with the following:<BR><EM>The core IIS7 release provides all the infrastructure to do URL rewriting for all resources (ASP.NET, ASP, PHP, HTML, etc).<BR></EM><EM>The Vista release won't have a URL rewriting rules engine built-in -- although we are looking at making one available as a download in the future.</EM></P>
<P>I was going to enhance <A href="/blog/post.aspx?postid=762">my urlMapping code </A>to mirror whatever&nbsp;new features&nbsp;are to come, but apparently there wont be any soon. Oh well, I guess I just have time to work on something else for now.</P>
