Recently when looking at the analytics logs for referring urls to my website, I noticed one from Hanselmen.com. It&#39;s actually a click-through from a comment I posted on his blog way back on April 21, 2006. His blog post that I commented on is titled &quot;<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselman11SuccessfulLargeProjects3OpenSourceApplications1CollossalFailure.aspx">Scott Hanselman, 11 Successful Large Projects, 3 Open Source Applications, 1 Collossal Failure</a>&quot;.



In Scott&#39;s post, he talks about how placing your tech related certification acronyms after your name in your email signatures and such is rather meaningless. He states &quot;*Folks go to school for 20+ years to put PhD after their name. I could go take a cert test now, but should it be displayed so prominently?*&quot;

My comments as posted:


*I think it&#39;s ok to put one or two after your name, but no more than that. And only use them in places where you&#39;re not already stating your certified; Like on your resumt and cover letter. It&#39;s a good thing in emails and/or blog comments to show your cert. But, I do agree that it doesn&#39;t compare to a Phd.

Now, reflecting back on this thought now that it&#39;s October 2008... What the heck was I thinking? It is absolutely meaningless for me to place &quot;*MCSD&quot;* after my name in the signature of the blog comment. 



Today my opinion is a bit different, so I thought I&#39;d post on this to point out my change in opinion.



You need to think about context when placing certs after your name. Basically, the only places it&#39;s usefull are in email and letter signatures. However, keep it simple by listing only 1 or 2: 



*Chris Pietschmann, MCSD*



Or even better, add a second or third line to your signature that lists the most prominent certs and/or credentials.



*Chris Pietschmann

Microsoft Certified Solution Developer*



Or



*Chris Pietschmann

Microsoft MVP - Windows Live Platform*



Here&#39;s the email signature that I&#39;ve started using lately. Just my name, followed by notable &quot;titles&quot;, with nothing appended to my name. And, notice that I&#39;m only listing my Microsoft MVP award since it&#39;s the most relavent and doesn&#39;t get devalued by listing other non-relevent credentials. 



*Chris Pietschmann

President - Simplovation LLC

Microsoft MVP - Windows Live Platform

<a href="http://simplovation.com">http://simplovation.com</a>

<a href=""></a>*



Doesn&#39;t it look much better/usefull than the following?



*Chris Pietschmann, MVP, MCSD, MCAD, MCP *



And, finally, here&#39;s some rules to use when listing your certs by your name: 

<ul>
	<li>Only include 1 or 2 credentials/certs. Any more will just clutter things up.

	</li>
	<li>Always make sure it&#39;s necessary/relavent to list them in the first place.</li>
	<li>Never list your certs after your name when you comment on blog posts!</li>
	<li>If you have a PhD, then you better put it after your name! </li>
</ul>
