I was looking through the code of the new <a href="http://codeplex.com/blogengine">BlogEngine.NET </a>project last week, and noticed that it implements the ASP.NET Provider Model. Cool an example I can study! I've been trying to spend some time lately to learn more about design patterns, so this was an interesting find for me.

If you look at the code for <a href="http://codeplex.com/blogengine">BlogEngine.NET</a> you'll see that it is a rather simple application that demonstrates a working implementation of the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479030.aspx">ASP.NET Provider Model </a>that you can learn from.
