<strong>Is PietschSoft.VE Dead?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve had a couple people ask me lately if the <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">PietschSoft.VE</a> project is dead since there hasn&#39;t been a release in about 2 months. The answer is: No, it isn&#39;t dead, I just haven&#39;t had alot of time the last few weeks to work on it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Ajax</strong>
</p>
<p>
I am actually still working on adding full Ajax support, using UpdatePanels as the enablers. It&nbsp;is turning out to be pretty cool.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Virtual Earth v5</strong>
</p>
<p>
Also, since Microsoft recently released <a href="http://dev.live.com/virtualearth">Virtual Earth v5</a>, I have my work cut out rewriting the pushpin, polygon and polyline code to use the new Shape layers.
</p>
<p>
So, don&#39;t worry, the project is very much still alive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 11/7/2007:</strong> There is a new version of PietschSoft.VE, and it has been renamed to <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">Web.Maps.VE</a>! Web.Maps.VE has a <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">much richer Ajax feature set</a> than PietschSoft.VE. It is located here: <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx</a>
