<p>Time is the scarcest resource we have. More scarce than land, More scarce than water. More scarce than money. This is one of the reasons that life is so precious.</p>
<p><em>"A penny saved is a penny earned." - Benjamin Franklin</em></p>
<p>This famous quote from Benjamin Franklin can also be applied to Time. We only have so much time. We need to choose wisely how we spend it.</p>
<p>An hour spent reading useless Facebook status updates is one less hour spent with your family.</p>
<p>An hour spent watching TV is one less hour spent reading a book to learn something new.</p>
<p>An hour spent playing video games is one less hour spent bonding with your child.</p>
<p>Choose wisely what you spend your time on. You only have so much left.</p>
