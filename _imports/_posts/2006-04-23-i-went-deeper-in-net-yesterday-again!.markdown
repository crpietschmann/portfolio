<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">I attended <a href="http://wi-ineta.org/didn">Deeper in .NET</a> yesterday, along with a few hundred others. It was an excellent day filled with .NET goodness. I&rsquo;m not sure what the actual attendance count was, but I guess it was higher than last year&rsquo;s event.</p>
&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">We learned about:</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: list .5in"><a href="http://windowscommunication.net/">WCF (formerly Indigo) </a>Top to Bottom with <a href="http://dasblonde.net">Michele Leroux Bustamante</a> </li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: list .5in">Anatomy of a Successful ASP.NET Application: Inside <a href="http://dasblog.info/">DasBlog </a>with <a href="http://computerzen.com">Scott Hanselman</a> </li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: list .5in">ADO.NET 2.0 Integration with SQL Server 2005 with <a href="http://www.thedatafarm.com/blog">Julia Lerman</a> </li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: list .5in">AJAX and <a href="http://atlas.asp.net">Atlas </a>with Bill Hatfield </li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: list .5in">Using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/winfx/reference/presentation/default.aspx">WPF (formerly Avalon) </a>to Create Compelling User Interfaces with Jason Beres</li>
</ol> &nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">The presentations were excellent and at least as good as last year. The best part about the event is the fact that it&rsquo;s completely FREE to attend! If you missed out this year, then you don&rsquo;t want to miss it next year.</p>
&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">The users group held an evangelism blogging contest for the event. To participate all you had to do was blog about the event ahead of time and send an email to register in the <a href="http://wi-ineta.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=145">WI .NET Users Group Evangelist Directory</a>. Then the WI .NET Users Group Executive Committee would collectively choose a winner and announce the winner at the Deeper in .NET 2006 event. The grand prize for the contest was a copy of MSDN Premium Subscription with Visual Studio 2005 Team Suite, worth over $10,000.</p>
&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">I am happy to say that I entered the blogging contest and won! I now have my very own MSDN Subscription for one year. Now that is an awesome prize!</p>
&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">There was also a total of about $70,000 dollars worth of prizes given away through out the day, so I wasn&rsquo;t the only one that brought something home. One of the prizes given away was another MSDN Subscription.</p>
&nbsp;
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">If you&rsquo;re a .NET developer and aren&rsquo;t already a member of the <a href="http://wi-ineta.org">Wisconsin .NET Users Group</a> then go to the official site (<a href="http://wi-ineta.org">http://wi-ineta.org</a>) and join; after all it&rsquo;s FREE.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"><strong>Update 4/24/2006:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt">I have to thank all the members of the WI .NET Users Group Executive Commitee, the MVP's that donated the subscription and any one else involved with the Evangelist Blogging contest. This is a great prize and awesome community recognition for my blogging efforts. It really inspires me to blog more and get more involved with the WI .NET Users Group.</p>
