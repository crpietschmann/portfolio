<p>Just as there is no business without something to sell; you do not have a product until you ship it.</p>
<p>What to ship? How to ship? When to ship? Where to ship?</p>
<p>There are many questions that need to be answered before shipping a product. However, one thing always remains true:<br /><strong>A product only succeeds if you ship it.</strong></p>
<p>It may be difficult to determine when/if/how/where your product fits. However, you can always reiterate and improve the product for the next release. Every product isn&rsquo;t as great at version 1 as it will be at version 2, 3 or even 4 or 5!</p>
<p>The most important thing to look at when shipping that version 1 product is:<br /><strong>Does this product provide greater value to a set of customers than what I&rsquo;ll be charging for it?</strong></p>
<p>If version 1 answers a resounding <strong>&ldquo;YES!&rdquo;</strong> to that question, then by all means get it shipped!</p>
<p>Of course version 2 will be more; have more. As will versions 3, 4 and so on. But there will never be a version 2 if version 1 doesn&rsquo;t come first.</p>
<p>So by all means ship it; take that risk! For your product to succeed you must first ship it!</p>
