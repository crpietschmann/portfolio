<P><STRONG>Good News:</STRONG> The website, Pietschsoft.com, seems to be back up.</P>
<P><STRONG>Bad News:</STRONG> Email still seems to be down.</P>
<P><STRONG>Here's the deal: </STRONG>My hosting provider, <A href="http://discountasp.net">http://discountasp.net</A>, got hit with a DDOS attack and consiquently my email and website were virtually completely down yesterday and today. Yesterday it was spotty, and today totally down. The outage was so bad it brought down their entire data center, including the <A href="http://discountasp.net">http://discountasp.net</A> website.</P>
<P><STRONG>Be Aware: </STRONG>If you emailed me from Thursday morning until ? (I'm not sure when exactly my email will be fully functioning again), please resend when to get a chance or followup to make sure I got it. Thanks!</P>
<P>I'll update this post when/if my site and email status changes.</P>
<P><STRONG>UPDATE 6/23/07: </STRONG>Ok, it seems as though both the website and email are both up and normal again. Hopefully it stays this way.</P>
