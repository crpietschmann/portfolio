<P>I installed SP2 Final yesterday. I had SP2 RC2 installed since it was released to the public. I hadn't encountered a single problem with RC2.</P>
<P>The enhancements of the WiFi support is awesome. Before SP2 I wasn't able to use WPA encryption, but now I can!! Yippee!! I love the popup blocker in IE, and I'm sure there are alot of other fixes that I'll just never have to worry about now.</P>
