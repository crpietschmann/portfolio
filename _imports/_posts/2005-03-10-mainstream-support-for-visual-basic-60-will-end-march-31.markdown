<P>Mainstream support for Visual Basic 6.0 will end March 31, 2005. Its kind of like <A title=Microsoft href="http://microsoft.com/" target=_blank>Microsoft</A> forcing us to all start using <A title=.NET href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target=_blank>.NET</A>. Fankly I'd rather I didn't have to use VB6 anymore anyway.</P>
<P>As of the end of 2002, you can no longer purchase any licenses for Visual Basic 6.0. In the event that you need additional licenses for VB6; Microsoft Volume Licensing allow downgrade rights under Volumne Licensing 6.0. Customers who purchase the current release have full downgrade rights to previous versions. In simple terms, if you own a license for Visual Basic <A title=.NET href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target=_blank>.NET</A> 2003 you are allowing to use Visual Basic 6 instead; the only downside to downgrading your license is that you can't have both the current&nbsp;version and the older one installed at the same time.&nbsp;To determine if you are eligible for downgrade rights, check the product's EULA.</P>
