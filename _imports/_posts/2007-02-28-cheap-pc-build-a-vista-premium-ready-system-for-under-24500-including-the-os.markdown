People keep talking about how Vista (w/ Aero enabled) will only run on high-end systems, and that everyone will have to buy a new computer in order to run Vista. Well, I have a laptop thats 3 years old (2.4Ghz Celeron, 512MB Ram) and it runs Vista ok without Aero glass enabled (because it doesn&#39;t have a capable video card). Based on that, pretty much any system that is 2 years old should run Vista (w/ Aero enabled) just fine as long as it has 1GB Ram and a video card that support DirectX 9.
</p>
<p>
Now to prove that you don&#39;t need a high end system to run Vista with Aero glass enabled, I decided to spec out a system for under $500 including the OS that will handle Vista just fine.

For a <strong>total cost of $493.93</strong> you get:

</p>
<p>
I know, I didn&#39;t include shipping. With shipping it comes to a total of $522.44.
</p>
<p>
Now, before you complain about about the lower end specs, let me explain a little as to why I chose the items that I did:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Motherboard</strong> - The motherboard does support the Intel Core 2 Duo, so later on down the road if you wanted to upgrade your system to make it faster, all you&#39;ll need to do is buy a faster CPU.</li>
	<li><strong>Memory</strong> - I only included 1GB to stay on the cheap and Vista does run just fine with 1GB. The motherboard supports up to 2GB and the Ram I included is 1GB on a single stick. So, to add more Ram all you need to do is buy another 1GB stick. 
	</li>
	<li><strong>Video Card</strong> - I chose a PCI-Express x16 video card instead of including a motherboard with integrated graphics so that you could upgrade it at a later date. I also chose 256MB of onboard Ram because I know that Vista and alot of games will run just fine on that. 
	</li>
	<li><strong>Vista 64-bit</strong> - The reason I chose the 64-bit version of Vista over the 32-bit version is because all the newer CPU&#39;s are 64-bit (including the Celeron D that&#39;s listed abov) and this way you&#39;ll be sure that the operating system is able to use the CPU to it&#39;s fullest potential. Also, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Execution_Prevention">Data Execution Protection (DEP)</a> support in the 64-bit version is better that in the 32-bit version. This will give you better protection against buffer overrun exploits. 
	</li>
	<li><strong>Vista Home Premium</strong> - The reason I chose Home Premium over Ultimate is because Ultimate is $70 more and the average user will be able to do absolutely everything they need with Home Premium.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />
As you can see, I put alot of thought into specing out a system. The biggest point i keep in mind is the ability for the system to be upgraded. I don&#39;t like buying a complete new system every couple years either.
</p>
<p>
Wow! Now, that&#39;s a cheap system that will handle Windows Vista with Aero glass enabled, and it&#39;s the 64-bit version too! And guess what? It&#39;s very upgradable too!
