<p>Larry Clarkin presented at tonight&rsquo;s WI .NET Users Group meeting on the topic of "Overview of Web 2.0". He provided a very good description of what really is "Web 2.0"; and he had a whole 5 days to prepare. The reason he had only 5 days to prepare is because the presenter that was scheduled for tonight couldn't present. Well done Larry</p>

<p>One of the items discussed was Google, Yahoo and MS Virtual Earth mapping. If you are interested in implementing mapping within your ASP.NET applications then you should check out my <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=PietschSoftVE3">Open Source ASP.NET Virtual Earth mapping control</a>.<br /> PietschSoft.VE: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=PietschSoftVE3">http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=PietschSoftVE3</a></p>
<p>On a related note, there was a disruptive and rude user group member in attendance tonight. I would like to apologize to&nbsp;all in attendance for the disruption, and I thank Larry, Scott, Gerry and anyone else involved in handling the situation. If the meeting tonight was your first; I must assure you that this&nbsp;is not a normal occurrence. I am actually a little embarrassed that a fellow community member would be disrespectful of a presenter and be so disruptive</p>
<p>The next meeting won&rsquo;t be until January; there is no meeting in December because of the holidays. Also, there will be a new venue (to be determined) for future meetings; see the wi-ineta.org site for updates on where they will be.</p>
