<p><img src="/image.axd?picture=%2f2015%2f07%2fbuildazure_header_city.png" alt="" />While <a href="http://buildazure.com/2015/07/16/mcsd-azure-solutions-architect-certification/" target="_blank">studying for the MCSD: Azure Solutions Architect certification</a> I decided to blog a lot more on all things Azure. Also, instead of posting those posts here, I decided to create a completely new blog site dedicated just to "all things Azure" This new site is <a href="http://buildazure.com" target="_blank">BuildAzure.com</a>. I have also created the <a href="http://twitter.com/buildazure" target="_blank">@BuildAzure</a> twitter account associated with the new blog.</p>
<p>I will still blog here, as I have for over 10 years so far. However, my posts relating to Microsoft Azure technologies and features will mostly be posted to the new <a href="http://buildazure.com" target="_blank">Build Azure blog</a>. The purpose of the new blog is to have a specific place focusing solely on Microsoft Azure, while my existing / personal blog will still remain for posting other random geek and developer related content as always.</p>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="/image.axd?picture=%2f2015%2f07%2fbuildazure_logo2.png" alt="" />Additionally, I am interested in accepting guest posts to the Build Azure blog. This is also one of the reasons I created the new site instead of just posting my Azure related posts here. If you are interested in guest posting to BuildAzure.com please <a href="http://pietschsoft.com/contact" target="_blank">contact me</a>.</p>
