<P>Move Inc. has just hired <A href="http://investor.move.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111114&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=993908&amp;highlight=">Lorna Borenstein&nbsp;to be the new&nbsp;President of Move Inc</A>.</P>
<P><STRONG>How does this relate to Google?</STRONG></P>
<P>Lorna Borenstein is <A href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070329.wwisewords0329/BNStory/specialSmallBusiness/home">married </A>to <A href="http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#lawee">David Lawee (Vice President, Marketing at Google).</A></P>
<P>Even though Lorna Borenstein has a large list of really impressive qualifications (and am in no way trying to belittle that, I do find them quite impressive), I can't help but speculate that the Move Inc. Board of Directors may have took the fact of who she's married to into consideration&nbsp;when deciding to hire her.</P>
<P>Move Inc. has been making changes over the last year and are continuing to make changes to revitalize the company, and I am wondering what new "ties" (completely speculating) to Google this new hire may bring for Move Inc.</P>
<P>I base this on the fact that I know I can't keep my work completely&nbsp;secret from my spouse, and I'm sure they are no different.</P>
