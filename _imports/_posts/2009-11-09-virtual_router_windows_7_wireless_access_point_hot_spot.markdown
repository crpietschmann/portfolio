<p>Over the last week some of you may have heard about Connectify. It&rsquo;s an app that unleashes the &ldquo;Virtual WiFi&rdquo; and Wireless Hosted Network features of Windows 7 to turn a PC into a Wireless Access Point or Hot Spot. Well, I looked into what it would take to build such an app, and it really wasn&rsquo;t that difficult since Windows 7 has all the API&rsquo;s built in to do it. After some time of looking things up and referencing the &ldquo;Wireless Hosted Network&rdquo; C++ sample within the WIndows 7 SDK, I now have a nice working version of the application to release. I&rsquo;m calling this project &ldquo;Virtual Router&rdquo; since it essentially allows you to host a software based wireless router from your laptop or other PC with a Wifi card. Oh, and did I mention that this is FREE and OPEN SOURCE!</p>
