<P>I watch a video on <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com">http://channel9.msdn.com</A> about how we will be able to mix C++, C# and VB.NET code files within the same project in Visual Studio 2005. Watch the video here: <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=19445">http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=19445</A></P>
<P>I have an idea to take this one step further. It would be cool if the IDE would be able to convert C#, VB.NET and C++.NET code to any of the others. This way a VB.NET developer could load a C# application, edit in VB.NET, then save it back to C#. Then a C++.NET developer could load the the same C# application, edit in C++.NET, then save it back to C#. Then finally the C# developer could edit the app in C#. You could have three developers (one VB.NET, one C# and one C++ developer)&nbsp;work on the same project and they would never have to know the syntax of any of the other language to edit any of the code in the application. This way you could achieve true language independance.</P>
<P>Now wouldn't that be AWESOME??</P>
