Over a year ago I launch the <a href="http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com">Virtual Router</a> project, and over that time it has become fairly popular! Virtual Router is downloaded nearly 7,000 time per week!  
<a href="http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com/">Download Virtual Router Here!</a>  
<a href="http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com">Virtual Router</a> is a free, open source software based router for PCs running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2. Using Virtual Router, users can wirelessly share any internet connection (Wifi, LAN, Cable Modem, Dial-up, Cellular, etc.) with any Wifi device (Laptop, Smart Phone, iPod Touch, iPhone, Android Phone, Zune, Netbook, wireless printer, etc.) These devices connect to Virtual Router just like any other access point, and the connection is completely secured using WPA2 (the most secure wireless encryption.)  
<a href="http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com">Virtual Router</a> is superior to Connectify because it is:  <ol>   <li>Open Source </li>    <li>Not Ad-Supported </li>    <li>Not bloated with many features you wont use or care about </li>    <li>Simple and not confusing to use </li> </ol>  
&#160;  
Did I mention that <a href="http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com">Virtual Router</a> is Open Source software, and <a href="http://connectify.me">Connectify</a> is not?
