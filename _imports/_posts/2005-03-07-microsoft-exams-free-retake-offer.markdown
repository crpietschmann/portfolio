<P></SPAN>Between February 28 and May 31, 2005, you can use a special code&nbsp;when you&nbsp;register for your exams and if you fail you'll be able to retake it for FREE. This offer is available worldwide.</P>
<P>I'm going to make use of this offer soon, even if it is to just give me a good piece of mind. I've never failed an exam (knock on wood), and hope I wont need the retake.</P>
