<p>We naturally tend to resist change and cling to our comfort zones.</p>
<p>Venture out and try something new on a regular basis. You might fail; you might succeed. But, you will never know which if you don&rsquo;t try.</p>
<p>The only way to truly grow as a person, both personally and professionally, is to step out where you&rsquo;ve never been and try something new. You WILL surprise yourself with what you can handle when you set aside fear and embrace novelty.</p>
