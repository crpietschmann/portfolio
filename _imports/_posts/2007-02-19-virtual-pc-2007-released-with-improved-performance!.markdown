<P>Microsoft released Virtual PC 2007 today. I've been waiting for this since Virtual PC 2004 wont install on the 64-bit version of Vista.</P>
<P>I just installed Virtual PC 2007, turned on hardware virtualization and loaded up the Ubuntu virtual machine I previously installed on Virtual Server 2005. I'm actually seeing that the&nbsp;exact same&nbsp;Ubuntu virtual machine&nbsp;performs much better under Virtual PC 2007 running on the same PC as it did under Virtual Server 2005.</P>
<P>I did see one peculiar this when installing the 64-bit version of Virtual PC 2007. It installs under "Program Files (x86)". Once the install finished, I fired it up and it runs under a 32-bit binary. This is really strange behavior for the "64-bit" version. Is this correct? Or, did they put up the wrong installer?</P>
