<P>The latest episode of the MSDN .NET Show features a great interview with Scott Guthrie and Bill Staples on IIS 7.0. The show includes a 30 minute interview about the product, along with 30 minutes of demos.</P>

<P>The latest IIS 7.0 Beta will be included in Windows Vista Beta 2. Also, it&nbsp;will be shipping with Vista, and will be included in the "home" editions as well. I'm hoping the final release of IIS 7 will ship with the RTM of Vista, and I don't have to wait for the Vista Server RTM to use it.</P>
