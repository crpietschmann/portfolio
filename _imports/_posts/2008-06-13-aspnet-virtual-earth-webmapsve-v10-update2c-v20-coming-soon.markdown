<p>Today, I released the 8th update (<a href="http://simplovation.com/blog/post.aspx?n=webmapsvev10008updatereleased">v1.00.08</a>) release to the <a href="http://simplovation.com/page/webmapsve10.aspx">Simplovation Web.Maps.VE v1.0 ASP.NET AJAX Virtual Earth Mapping Server Control</a>. This control has <a href="http://simplovation.com/page/webmapsve10/roadmap.aspx">come along way since the initial (v1.00.00) release last October</a>. It&nbsp;greatly simplifies the implementation of Virtual Earth into any ASP.NET web application by enabling full server-side (.net, C#, VB.NET) control of the map, while eliminating the need to write javascript/jscript. Unless of course you want to write javascript; in which case Web.Maps.VE has a full client-side javascript api that allows an&nbsp;unlimited number of customizations to be done.</p>
<p>I have also been working hard to meet the <a href="http://simplovation.com/blog/Post.aspx?n=WebMapsVEv20ComingSoon">deadline of June 30th for the release of Web.Maps.VE v2.0</a>. This release will greatly improve upon the v1.0 release by adding Shape Layer support, improved 3D map support, eliminating the dependency on the AjaxControlTookit, among other things.</p>
