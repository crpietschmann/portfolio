Unfortunately, it hasn’t been maintained by Microsoft in a long time and is closed sourced. Thankfully, there’s been a movement to finally get Windows Live Writer released as Open Source. Thanks to Scott Hanselman and <a href="http://openlivewriter.org/" target="_blank">MANY others</a>, the all new <a href="http://openlivewriter.org/" target="_blank">Open Live Writer</a> has now been released!</p> <p><a href="/images/postsOpenLiveWriterScreenshot.png"><img title="OpenLiveWriterScreenshot" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="OpenLiveWriterScreenshot" src="/images/postsOpenLiveWriterScreenshot_thumb.png" width="745" height="772"></a></p> <p>Download it here: <a href="http://openlivewriter.org" target="_blank">http://openlivewriter.org</a></p> <p>The new Open Live Writer is licensed under the MIT License, and the open source project is hosted up on GitHub. Open Live Writer also a project supported by the <a href="http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects" target="_blank">.NET Foundation</a>.</p> <p>Lastly, as proof that Open Live Writer works with BlogEngine.NET (the software I use to host this blog,) I have authored and published this post using it. It’s nice to finally be able to use Live Writer again, and I have missed using it.</p> <p>P.S. Sorry about the nested, inception screenshot but I just couldn’t help it. <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="/images/postswlEmoticon-smile.png"></p>
