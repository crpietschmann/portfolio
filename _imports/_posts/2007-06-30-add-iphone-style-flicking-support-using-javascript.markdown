I've been testing some of my code lately in Firefox 3.0 and along with all the iPhone hype, I thought I'd write up some simple JavaScript code that allows me to enable iPhone style flicking support within my own apps.

<A href="/download/javascript/iphoneflickui/">Go check it out</A>, it's actually pretty neat! And, it's entirely HTML and JavaScript code.

It currently only works in Safari 3.0, Internet Explorer 7 and the Apple iPhone. Well, hopefully the iPhone, I don't have one to test it on.
