I know this post is a bit delayed, but a couple days ago Microsoft released Virtual Earth v4. Basically this new version is v3 with some stuff added. The major addition is the 3D maps. Now this feature is cool.

I still have to check compatibility of my PietschSoft.VE3 control with the VE4 JavaScript library. I also think I may be spawning off a new PietschSoft.VE control for this new version.
