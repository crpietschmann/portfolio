Well, I didn&#39;t find a new bug, but it is the first time I discovered a bug in SQL Server by just doing my everyday job.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d post the code for the SQL Server user defined function that I wrote if I could, but I can&#39;t (confidential). Its nice to have a reminder once in awhile that even Microsoft&#39;s software has bugs.
