<p>I really haven't been reading enough books of the the last few years. Sure I read a ton of blogs and such online, but what about books? Books are nice, cohesive collections of information; at least most of the time. There are a lot of things I'd like to learn more about, both related to computers and not. So, sometime in January (this wasn't a new years resolution, just a coincidence), I decided to try to read at minimum 12 books throughout the year. Basically, at least 1 book each month, and after seemingly falling behind a few times, to my surprise, it seems that I am on track.</p>
<p>Here's the list of books that I've read so far this year in order of first to most recent:</p>

</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that it took me anywhere from 1 to 3 months to find the time to read some of these books.</p>
<p>The book I am currently reading is...</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/29ziCkt">Be the Pack Leader: Use Cesar's Way to Transform Your Dog ... And Your Life</a> by <a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/">Cesar Millan</a></p>
<p>Wow, and to my surprise I'm currently on book number 11 for the year. Maybe I'll be able to read a total of 12 or 13 books before the years end. I guess only time will tell.</p>
<p>Happy Reading!</p>
