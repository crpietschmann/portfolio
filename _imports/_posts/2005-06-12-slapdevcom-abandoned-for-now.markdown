<P>I had some dissapointments with the hosting service I was using for <a title="SlapDev.com" href="http://SlapDev.com" target="_blank">SlapDev.com</a> and with the Community Server app that I was using for it. I'm not sure if my problems were all to do with the hosting service, all to do with Community Server, or somewhere in between.</P>
<P>All my sites are back on <A href="http://discountasp.net">http://discountasp.net</A> 's servers. I am very happy with there hosting service, especially after moving away and then having to move back. I definately recommend them to others.</P>
<P>Now for Community Server; I guess I'll have to do more testing befor I launch a site with it again.</P>
