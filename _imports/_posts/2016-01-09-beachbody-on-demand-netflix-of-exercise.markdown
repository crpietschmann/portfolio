<p>Personally, I've been a Beachbody customer since 2010 when I originally began my own personal fitness and health journey. I first started with P90X and then purchased the newer P90X3 from Beachbody and Tony Horton. For a long time the only way to do Beachbody workouts were to put in a DVD (in your TV, Computer or portable DVD player); while this works just fine there are a few things that can go wrong. What if the DVDs get scratched? or Lost? Fortunately, Beachbody has innovated recently with the all new <a href="https://www.teambeachbody.com/tbbsignup/-/tbbsignup/club?referringRepId=322348" target="_blank">Beachbody On Demand streaming service</a>. This service is like Netflix or Amazon Video from Beachbody workout programs.</p>
<h3>Workouts</h3>
<p>By subscribing to <a href="https://www.teambeachbody.com/tbbsignup/-/tbbsignup/club?referringRepId=322348" target="_blank">Beachbody On Demand</a> you get access to MANY different Beachbody workouts like: P90, P90X, P90X2, P90X3, TurboFire, Insanity, Insanity The Asylum, plus MANY more workouts all included in the small monthly subscription fee! You no longer have to purchase and commit to a single workout program. By subscribing to Beachbody On Demand you can try out many different workouts from various workout programs and find the program that you like the most as you get fit.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>your first month is completely FREE!</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the MANY various workout programs, Beachbody On Demand also have workouts that are exclusive to the the "on demand" service from Tony Horton, Autumn Calabrese, and Sagi Kalev.</p>
