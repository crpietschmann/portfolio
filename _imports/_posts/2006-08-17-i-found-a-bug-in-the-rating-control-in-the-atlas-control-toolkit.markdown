<p>I found a bug in the current release (60731) of the Atlas Control Toolkit. The bug I found is caused when you use the Rating control within a User Control and you have multiple instances of your User Control on a page. I hope this bug gets fixed soon, it sucks for someone who likes to make things reusable using User Controls.</p>
