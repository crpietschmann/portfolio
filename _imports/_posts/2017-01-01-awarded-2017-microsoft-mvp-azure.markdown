<p><img style="float: right;" src="/IMAGES%2fMVP_FullColor_ForScreen.png.jpgx" alt="" width="200px" />I received notice this morning that I have been awarded Microsoft MVP in the Azure expertise category. It's been a few years since I wasn't renewed as a Bing Maps MVP, and it feels great to be recognized for the work I've been doing with <a href="http://buildazure.com">BuildAzure.com</a>, the <a href="http://mkeazure.com">Milwaukee Azure group</a>, and other online and offline community contributions. This is certainly a great way to ring in the new year.</p>
<p><strong>Happy New Year! And, congratulations to all other renewed and newly awarded MVPs!</strong></p>

<p><em>P.S. I first posted this saying "2016". Oh boy, it's so easy to type/write the old yer at the beginning of a new year. Happy new year!!</em></p>
