<p>Every so often there are news headlines declaring that some person or company is an "overnight success." No personal reputation or business is ever built up overnight. It's a physical and social impossibility.</p>
<p>Every time there is an "overnight success" reference there is a person or company that has been working for 5, 10, 15 or more years. They have had <a href="/post/2013/09/08/Failure-Is-Greater-Success-Than-Success">many failures</a> over that time, learned from them, and have forged success by persevering through hardships of some kind. Success is hard work. Staying motivated through multiple failures is even harder.</p>
<p>Every "overnight success" is hard earned through perseverance to achieve some future dream.</p>
