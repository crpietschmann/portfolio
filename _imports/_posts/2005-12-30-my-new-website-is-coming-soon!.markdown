An new year and a new look for <a title="PietschSoft.com" href="http://PietschSoft.com" target="_blank">PietschSoft.com</a> is coming!

I am currently working on a new website for <a title="PietschSoft.com" href="http://PietschSoft.com" target="_blank">PietschSoft</a>.com. My blog isn't going anywhere. Since it is the main content of my site I am making it the center of my site. I am working on making existing URL's for my blog still work with the new site. But, I'm not sure if I'll maintain compatibility for the URL of the RSS feeds.

For any of you who are consuming the RSS feeds; they may break when I launch the new site. If any of them do; please visit <A HREF=""></A> for the new RSS feed URL.
