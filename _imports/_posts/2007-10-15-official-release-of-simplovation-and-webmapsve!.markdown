I am proud to announce that I have just officially launched <a href="http://simplovation.com/">Simplovation</a> and released our first product, <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">Web.Maps.VE</a>!

<h3>What is Simplovation?</h3>


<a href="http://simplovation.com/">Simplovation</a> is my new startup, and is a Micro-ISV. Our focus is on developing first class, resuable components and developer tools that target the .NET Framework.

<a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">Web.Maps.VE</a> is the latest, much evolved version of <a href="http://codeplex.com/pietschsoftve3">my open source control</a>. This is the only ASP.NET 2.0 server control that brings **Full ASP.NET AJAX Support** to implementing MS Virtual Earth mapping within an ASP.NET 2.0 application. You can now implement Virtual Earth functionality with **Only .NET Code**, and absolutely **No JavaScript Hassles!**
