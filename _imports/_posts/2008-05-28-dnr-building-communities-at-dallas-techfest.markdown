I just listened to episode <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=344">#344 of DotNetRocks</a>, that was released last week. This episode is on the topic of Building Communities, and the benefits of user groups. Normally each episode is very informative and top notch, but this episode is really rather interesting. Even though this is really not so much tech related, I really encourage anyone interested in user groups and dev/tech communities to take a listen.
