<P>I went to the <A title=MSDN href="http://msdn.microsoft.com" target=_blank>MSDN</A> Event in Milwaukee yesterday, and got the FREE DVD with Visual Studio 2005 Beta 1. This is just awesome, anyone attending the MSDN Events in August - September 2004 get this DVD. If you're not an MSDN subscriber, but want to get your hands on VS2005 Beta 1, just go to one of these MSDN Events. Hell, even if you are an MSDN subscriber, go to one of these events. Very informative.</P>
