I've had Google Analytics set up on my site since the middle of January so I can get an idea on what content gets the most traffic. The goal has been satisfied; I know which pages get the most hits. Now, if there were a way to integrate it within my RSS feed... but that is another topic to discuss elsewhere.

I was looking at some of my referral keywords from search engines, and I thought I'd share some of them. I was actually a little surprise that some of my posts ranked as high as they did with some of these keywords.

<STRONG>TOP 10 Keywords:</STRONG><BR>web messenger<BR>vista ultimate key<BR>vista ultimate product key<BR>msn web messenger<BR>webmessenger<BR>msn webmessenger<BR>webmessenger.msn.com<BR>vista ultimate cd key<BR>system.drawing.color<BR>asp.net 2.0 javascript

<STRONG>Keywords where I'm the First Result in the list:<BR></STRONG>sql parse<BR>javascript loop document

<STRONG>Strange (this actually kind of scares me):</STRONG><BR>i love web messenger

<STRONG>Before the MSDN Article (it wasn't my goal, but what can I do?):</STRONG><BR>vbscript error '800a03e9'

<STRONG>On First Page of Search Results:</STRONG><BR>wisconsin .net users group<BR>easiest version of linux<BR>build cheap media pc<BR>app.config .net 1.1<BR>asp.net multiline<BR>.net nested forms<BR>flash vista 64<BR>virtual earth v5<BR>virtual earth asp.net control<BR>like ms paint<BR>hex color C#<BR>.net extension methods<BR>indexer property c#<BR>64 bit internet explorer<BR>asp.net parse url<BR>receiveserverdata<BR>how to build a successful blog<BR>belkin driver<BR>urlmapping<BR>vb.net regex<BR>control dell laptop fan<BR>.net syntax highlighting<BR>vista dvd backup<BR>asp.net boundfield<BR>event log C#<BR>asp.net javascript include<BR>asp.net 2.0 javascript<BR>virtualization x64<BR>

As you can see my site comes up alot when searching for both MSN Web Messenger and Vista Ultimate Product Keys. I would prefer some of my more technical content come up instead, but I guess there are lot of people searching those two things. I have even had alot of people email and comment asking me to send them my Vista CD Key; as if I'm going to share it.

Hopefully next time I look through my referral keywords I'll find some more interesting and/or funny ones.
