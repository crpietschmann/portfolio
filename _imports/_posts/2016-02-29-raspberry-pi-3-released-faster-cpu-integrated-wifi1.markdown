<img style="float: right;" src="/images/posts/2016/02/RaspberryPi3MobelB.png" alt="" />It's only been a year since the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B was released, and to mark the 4th birthday of the Raspberry Pi a new Pi is being released today. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2cxvgT0" target="_blank">NEW Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</a>! This new Pi offers a faster CPU at 1.2Ghz, along with integrated 802.11n Wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.1 with Bluetooth LE.

Over the last few months I'd been wondering if a new Pi might come this year. After all, hardware keeps advancing so there's not much reason to stand still on RPi2 for long. I also didn't want to be spoiled by rumors, so I kept those thoughts to myself, with the possible comments on Twitter.

This morning I woke up, checked my feeds and found that the Raspberry Pi 3 is being released on this Leap Day of 2016.

Here's what's changed in Pi3 versus Pi2:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr><th>Pi 2</th><th>Pi 3</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>900 Mhz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU</td>
<td>**1.2 Ghz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU**</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1GB RAM</td>
<td>1GB RAM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>no integrated Wifi</td>
<td>**802.11n Wireless LAN**</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>no integrated Bluetooth</td>
<td>**Bluetooth 4.0 w/ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Other than the above changes, the <a href="http://amzn.to/2cxvgT0" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</a> is basically the same as the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. The Pi 3 is also completely backwards compatible with Raspberry Pi 1 and 2. The Pi 3 has the same form factor as the Pi2 and Pi2 Model B+.

Lastly, according to the <a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/iot" target="_blank">Microsoft IoT Dev Center</a>, the Windows 10 for IoT Core is supported on the Raspberry Pi 3!
