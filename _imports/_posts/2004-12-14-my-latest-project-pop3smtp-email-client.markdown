<P>I have currently and in the past had so many projects that I've wanted to create but just never actually went and fully developed them. Well, I have a new one I'm working on now and will force myself to finish it. I'm working on a POP3/SMTP EMail Client. I am working on making it support POP3 and SMTP for retrieving and sending email messages. I am also going to make it support the XMTP (eXtensible Mail Transfer Protocol) which is an XML transformation of the standard Internet Message Format. I'm thinking about using XMTP as the heart of how tha app saves messages to the hard drive. It'll be a little while 'till I get a EMail Client anyone can see, right now I'm working on creating a POP3 library and SMTP library that the client will actually use to retieve and send messages.</P>
