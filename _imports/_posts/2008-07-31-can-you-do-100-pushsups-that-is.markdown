<p>Today, I was introduced to <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">hundredpushups.com</a>, via a <a href="http://twitter.com/shanselman/statuses/873898459">Tweet by Scott Hanselman</a>. In short, the One Hundred Pushups training program is a simple program that requires about 30 minutes a week of exercise doing pushups, with the goal of working up to being able to do 100 consecutive pushups at the end of the 6 weeks program. This is such a simple program, it's free, and there isn't much easier than doing pushups.</p>

<h3>What is the hundred pushup program?</h3>
<p>Here's a quote from the website:</p>
<p><em>If you're serious about increasing your strength, follow this six week training program and you'll soon be on your way to completing 100 consecutive push ups!</em></p>
<p><em>Think there's no way <em><strong>you</strong></em> could do this? I think you can! All you need is a good plan, plenty of discipline and about 30 minutes a week to achive this goal!</em></p>
<p><em>No doubt some of you can already do 50 consecutive push ups, but let's face it, you're in a big minority. Most of you reading this won't even be able to manage 20 pushups. Actually, I'm sure many of you can't even do 10.</em></p>
<p><em>However, it really doesn't matter which group you fall into. If you follow the progressive push ups training program, I'm positive you'll soon be able to do 100 push ups!</em></p>

<h3>My Initial Test <br /></h3>
<p>I did the initial test today and was able to do 30 pushups. As I remember, I haven't been able to do many more consecutive pushups than this, even in high school when I did some light weight lifting for a little while. I started some other light weight lifting today as well, and I am planning to do other regular exercise (like walking, biking, etc.) and eat a little better as well. I actually went on my first 5 mile bike ride in 2 years the other day. I had to pump the tires up on my bike first of course.</p>
<p>I'll post my results of the One Hundred Pushups program here to keep you updated, and possibly help remind you to do it too.</p>
<p>So... How many pushups can you do? I encourage you to take the challenge.</p>
