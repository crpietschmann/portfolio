To follow or lead; that is the question.

No matter how you look at it, people in our society are constantly following in one capacity or another.

However, there are a few people that stand out / take risks / try new things. These are the leaders, the entrepreneurs, the wolves.

Without wolves the sheep would never discover any innovation, and the world would stagnate.

Are you a Sheep or a Wolf?
