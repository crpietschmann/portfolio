<A href="http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/">ASP.NET Web Matrix</A> was the Free ASP.NET editor back in the .NET 1.x days. The tool is actually <A href="http://www.asp.net/webmatrix/download.aspx?tabindex=4">still available for download</A>. The other day, I was thinking...

<STRONG>Why doesn't Microsoft make ASP.NET Web Matrix available as Shared Source?</STRONG>

Web Matrix was a really cool tool, and it's obviously been rendered obsolete by Visual Studio Express. However, there are still alot of really cool things done in the code, and I think it would be beneficial to the community if the source code were made available.

So, I decided to email <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu">Scott Guthrie</A> (I only chose him because I have no idea who else might have the correct authority to possibly make this happen.) the basic description and question stated above.

Within a day I got the following response from <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu">ScottGu</A>:

<EM>That is a good question. I will send some mail to the team to inquire whether we could make this happen.</EM>

<EM>Thanks,</EM>

<EM>Scott</EM>

Now, we can all wait and see if it'll happen. Hopefully there isn't too much "secret" proprietary code within Web Matrix that prevents Microsoft from releasing it under a <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/sharedsourcelicenses.mspx">Shared Source license</A>.
