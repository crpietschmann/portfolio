Paint.NET is a senior design project aided by a mentor at Microsoft.&nbsp; It is a paint program designed entirely by students and written using Microsoft&#39;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target="_blank" title="Microsoft .NET Framework">.NET Framework</a>.&nbsp; The program makes it easier to create and edit photos. It maintains some of the best features of the original MS-Paint application and includes new, powerful tools. Such new tools include a history storage for undos and redos, and powerful multi-layering which is often seen only in high-quality, expensive photo-applications. This product was engineered with the latest in graphics and coding technology such as the new C# language from Microsoft, and the GDI+ graphics libraries. These programming frameworks allowed for the creation of a speedy, responsive application with an amazing array of graphic capabilities.
