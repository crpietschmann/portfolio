<H3>Programming = Logical</H3>
<P>There is a lot of <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">logic</A> involved in computer programming, just as there is in Math. In college they teach you a lot of mathematics and how to use that same logical thinking with programming. It's true that if you're good at math, you may have the potential to&nbsp;be good at programming.</P>
<H3>Development = Creativity</H3>
<P>The development aspect of&nbsp;building a software solution is the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity">creative</A> aspect to programming.</P>
<P>When you design or architect a software solution there is a ton of creativity involved. You need to envision what the completed system will be like, and then decide how to design each piece/component to make up the final solution. This is just like an artist composing music, or creating a beautiful painting.</P>
<H3>Software Development = Logical Creativity</H3>
<P>When you combine programming (Logic) with development/design (Creativity), you get Logical Creativity.</P>
<P>Logical Creativity is also a learned skill, that a lot of managers (whom do not have a software background) do not understand. They see it as the magic in the box, but in fact the magic is in the Developer; the individual.</P>
<P>If you give 10 developers the exact same requirements; you'll get 10 different designs for the same solution. Just the same as if you take 10 painters, and have them paint a portrait of the same subject.</P>
<P>Software Development = Logical Creativity; just think about it.</P>
