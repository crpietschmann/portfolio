Once in a while you need to pause and rest for a second so you can collect your thoughts before pushing forward. The rush of pushing forward all the time leaves little time to reflect on what&rsquo;s been done and where you&rsquo;re headed.

Don&rsquo;t forget to force yourself to regain a little perspective once in a while.

Stop. Take a breath of fresh air. Now, GO!
