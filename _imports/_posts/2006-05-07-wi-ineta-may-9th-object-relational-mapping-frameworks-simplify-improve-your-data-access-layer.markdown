The next Wisconsin .NET Users Group meeting is just two days away. One of our local MVP's, <a href="http://adapdev.com">Sean McCormack</a> will be speaking on the topic of "Object Relational Mapping Frameworks: Simplify &amp; Improve Your Data Access Layer". I'm looking forward to this months meeting since this is a topic that I don't know a whole lot about. Several frameworks will be covered; including <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org/">NHibernate</a>, <a href="http://adapdev.com/codus/index.aspx">Codus</a>, Elementary and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/linq/">DLinq </a>specification among others. Other ORM capabilities will also be covered; such as lazy loading, object caching, composite keys, saving and retrieving nested objects, OQL, dynamic objects and more.

Meeting Time: May 9th, 7:00 PM

<a href="http://wi-ineta.org">Wisconsin .NET Users Group</a>
