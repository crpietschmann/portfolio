The PietschSoft.VE3 library is really taking shape and has been downloaded 100+ times already. I&#39;ve even had someone contact me about using my code as the basis for a mapping control they need to create for a project they are working on.

In case you haven&#39;t heard of or seen this project; the PietschSoft.VE3 library is an ASP.NET server control that wraps up the functionality provided by&nbsp; Microsoft Virtual Earth v3. The major goal of this project is to allow ASP.NET developers to use Microsoft Virtual Earth mapping in their applications without requiring them to do any JavaScript programming if they don&#39;t want to. Let&#39;s face it, most ASP.NET developers dislike JavaScript programming.
