<p>Our society has a tendency to constantly focus on failure. Success is often short lived and generally only achieves "15 minutes of fame."</p>
<p><em>"I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed." - Michael Jordan</em></p>
<p>Failures can easily overshadow successes. It is important to never let those failures convince you to quit, for failure teaches you far more than success ever will.</p>
<p>Successes teach you that what you did worked that one time. However Failure teaches you what to do in order to succeed.</p>
<p>Every time you fail; reflect on what you did and what happened. Determine what flaw caused the failure and you will know exactly what to do differently in similar circumstances to succeed every time.</p>
<p>No success is without previous failure.</p>
