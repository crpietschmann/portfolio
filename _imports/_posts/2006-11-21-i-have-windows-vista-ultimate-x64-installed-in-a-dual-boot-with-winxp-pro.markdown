<p>The installation went really smooth. I just booted up the box with the Vista intallation DVD in the drive, and installed Vista on a newly created partition (not the partition WinXP is on). And, it setup dual boot automatically. It couldn't have been easier. Oh, yeah, and&nbsp;it only took 15-20 minutes for the install; that really beats the approximate 1 hour WinXP takes.</p>
<p>Vista runs extremely smooth and the overall experience feels smother&nbsp;than WinXP Pro on the same pc.&nbsp;The specs of my pc are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+ Processor</li>
<li>1GB DDR2 800Mhz RAM</li>
<li>300GB SATA 3.0Gb/s Hard Drive</li>
<li>NVidia GeForce 6600 Video Card w/ 256MB DDR Video Ram&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't had any major issues with running the 64-bit version of Vista yet. The only issue I've encountered is that my sound card doesn't work due to not having a device driver for it. I am however downloading one from the manufacturer.</p>
