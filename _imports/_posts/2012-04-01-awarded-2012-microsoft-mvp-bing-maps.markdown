<p>Whether I won MVP or not I would still do what I do. My passion for technology and the pleasure of helping others it what drives me. This marks the 5th time I've been awarded Microsoft MVP, and am honored for this recognition.</p>
<p>Thank you Microsoft!</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to all April Fools MVP's; new and renewed!</strong></p>
