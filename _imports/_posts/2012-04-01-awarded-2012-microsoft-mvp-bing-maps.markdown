Whether I won MVP or not I would still do what I do. My passion for technology and the pleasure of helping others it what drives me. This marks the 5th time I've been awarded Microsoft MVP, and am honored for this recognition.

Thank you Microsoft!

**Congratulations to all April Fools MVP's; new and renewed!**
