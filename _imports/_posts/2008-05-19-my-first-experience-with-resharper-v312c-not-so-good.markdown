A while back I won a free license for <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html">JetBrains ReSharper v3.1</a> at one of the monthly <a href="http://wi-ineta.org">WI .NET Users Group</a> meetings. Today, I finally got around to installing it to check it out.
</p>
<p>
I found some of the code hightlighting/outlining features to be pretty neat, but.... But, I experienced a 1/2 to 1 second lag for Visual Studio 2008&nbsp;to do anything after I installed ReSharper. This lag was quite an annoyance. So, consiquentially,&nbsp;I uninstalled ReSharper to get my VS performance back.
</p>
<p>
I also had another issue with it; After I uninstalled ReSharper from my machine I noticed that all the Intellisense in Visual Studio wasn&#39;t there anymore. What?!!?! I did a quick search and found instructions on JetBrains Knowledge Base on <a href="http://support.jetbrains.com/kb/entry.jspa?categoryID=28&amp;externalID=141">how to Fix Intellisense after uninstalling ReSharper</a>. few... At least it was easy to fix. I was afraid I would have to reinstall VS. There is also one thing I find funny about this &quot;bug&quot;, the knowledge base article dates back to Dec. 2004. I would normally expect that JetBrains would have fixed this issue by now. Afterall, why in the world would anyone not want Intellisense after uninstalling ReSharper?
</p>
<p>
Mayber I&#39;ll try out ReSharper 4.0 after it comes out, hopefully they&#39;ll fix the performance issues in that release. However, I&#39;m surprised that v3 has performance issues this bad.
</p>
<p>
Do any of you use ReSharper? If so, how is the Visual Studio performance for you?
