<p>It's been forever since I posted anything about Mono, but this stuff deserves some attention. </p> <p><strong>Mono's Winforms 2.0 is now API Complete</strong> </p> <p>Yesterday, it was announced that the System.Windows.Forms support in Mono (an open source implementation of the .NET Framework targeting Linux, MacOS, Windows, etc.) has finally reached a state of being API complete. This means the public API for WinForms in Mono is exactly the same as in .NET; with a total of 12,776 methods! The first check-in of WinForms occurred on July 8th, 2004; which means it took almost 4 years to implement.<br>Original Source: <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/May-13.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/May-13.html</a> </p> <p><strong>First Moonlight Release</strong> </p> <p>On May 13, the Mono guys released the first public release of Moonlight, supporting the Silverlight 1.0 profile for Linux. If you don't know what Moonlight is; Moonlight is an open source implementation of Microsoft's Silverlight for Linux.<br>Original Source: <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/May-13-1.html">http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/May-13-1.html</a> </p> <p>I'm excited to see that <a href="http://mono-project.com">Mono</a> is making some awesome progress in bringing the greatness that is the .NET Framework to Unix, Linux, MacOS, and other operating systems that are non-Microsoft. Way to go guys! </p>
