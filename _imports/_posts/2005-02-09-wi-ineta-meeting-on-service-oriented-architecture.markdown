I went to the <a href="http://wi-ineta.org" target="_blank" title="Wisconsin .NET Users Group">WI-INETA</a> meeting last night. Matt Terski presented on Service Oriented Architectures. Matt is an accomplished software architect who has had significant real-world experience working with Fortune&nbsp;500 customers on developing services oriented architectures with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target="_blank" title=".NET">.NET</a> technologies. Matt is also the President of <a href="http://www.serliosoft.com/">Serlio Software</a> which is located in Wauwatosa, WI. You can view Matt&#39;s blog at <a href="http://www.terski.com/blog">http://www.terski.com/blog</a>. He provided an awesome presentation explaining the theory and practice of SOA in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target="_blank" title=".NET">.NET</a>.

I finally one a door prize. The prize I won consisted of: Visual Studio Tools for Office, a book on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target="_blank" title=".NET">.NET</a> development with Office and a book on building InfoPath solutions. Yippee!! I plan on building some cool add-ins/tools for Office; I have to utilize this awesome stuff that I got.
