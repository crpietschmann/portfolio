Since my arm/hand was injured last week, I have started using the Windows Vista Speech Recognition and it is helping me to type since I can only type with one hand.&nbsp; It still takes a little while to type things, but it does help with some of the frustration.&nbsp; In fact I typed this post by dictation, with a little help of one handed typing.&nbsp; Speech recognition is fairly simple to use but it does take some getting used to; you need to learn the commands and I have yet to get it working correctly with visual studio 2008.

Does anyone know of any speech addins for visual studio 2008? I&#39;m not exactly sure how long it&#39;ll take for me to heal, but anything too ease the one handed typing is appreciated.

Even though I can type with one hand fairly well, it does get old.
