Really the only feature that Microsoft has promised for the next version of Windows after Windows Vista, is Multi-Touch. We&#39;re all becoming familiar with the idea of multi-touch displays thanks to the iPhone and iPod Touch, but it&#39;s about time for this capability to come to the PC (or rather Laptop / Tablet). I haven&#39;t owned a Table PC yet, but I&#39;ve had my sights on getting one for a while. I just found out that the <a href="http://www.dell.com/tablet?s=bsd&amp;cs=04">Dell XT (Dell&#39;s version of the convertable laptop / tablet)</a> not only has touch capability, but through it&#39;s capacitive digitizing hardware is capable of Multi-Touch as well!

Below is a video on YouTube demonstrating the <a href="http://www.dell.com/tablet?s=bsd&amp;cs=04">Dell XT</a>&#39;s Multi-Touch capability enabled by the new &quot;firmware&quot; that is supposed to be out now.

Being a developer, one of my initial thoughts about the Dell XT is to wonder if there is a programming API for the Multi-Touch capabilities to be able to take advantage of it within my own applications. There doesn&#39;t seem to be an API in the works, but there is a request for one over at ideastorm.com, so go vote for it and get Dell to implement one.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also, another related idea, I wonder when Dell or anyone else will start to come out with LCD displays with this same Multi-Touch capable technology?<br />
<br />
Now if only I could justify purchasing one of these for myself...<br />
