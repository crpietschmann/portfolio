<p>
Tonight I released v0.05 of the PietschSoft.VE3 Virtual Earth mapping control for ASP.NET.
</p>
<p>
Major enhancements this release brings:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Added GeoRSS and VECollection Layer support </li>
	<li>Added simple VS Design-Time support </li>
	<li>Added VEMap.VEMapJSInclude property so the control can be pointed to a Virtual Earth mapping .js file (a custom one)&nbsp;other than the one hosted by Microsoft.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I&#39;m trying to put out a new release with every couple features/fixes that are done. If you have any questions/comments about the control, just post it on the PietschSoft.VE3 Forums.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 8/15/2006:</strong> The control has been downloaded 68 times since I put it up on CodePlex a week ago, and the page on CodePlex has had over 1200 hits. There seems to be a decent amount of interest in this type of control. It is a real motivational factor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 11/5/2007: </strong>There is a newer version of PietschSoft.VE that has been renamed <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">Web.Maps.VE </a>and it&#39;s located here: <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx</a>
