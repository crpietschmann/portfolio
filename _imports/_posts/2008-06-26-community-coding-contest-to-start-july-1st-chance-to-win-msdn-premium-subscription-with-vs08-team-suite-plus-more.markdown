<p>
A few weeks ago Microsoft sent me 3 MSDN Premium Subscriptions with Visual Studio 2008 Team Suite to give away to members of the community. I thought long and hard, and the best way I could come up with who to give them to is to hold a coding contest. So I&#39;m happy to announce the <a href="http://communitycodingcontest.org">Community Coding Contest</a>! <strike>I don&#39;t have the website up yet, but I&#39;ll get it up as soon as I can.</strike> The website is now Live! 
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are the Rules?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Here are the basic rules for the contest. Once the website is launched, I will post a more complete listing of rules there.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>All Code Submissions need to be licensed with some sort of Open Source or Shared Source license that allows it to be distributed (including source code) from the contest website and looked at/compiled/executed by any community member. </li>
	<li>All Code Submissions need to be created using one or more of the following tools: Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Express/Standard/Professional, SQL Server 2005/2008 Express/Standard/etc. </li>
	<li>All Code Submissions must run on the Windows platform and can be Web or Desktop/Windows applications; that means Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008 and/or IIS. </li>
	<li>You are inelligible to win if you are an active Microsoft MVP.</li>
	<li>You must provide us with a United States shipping address upon submitting your code entry, that we can ship your prizes to if you win. <strong>The United States shipping address is required, since the MSDN Subscriptions are region locked to the United States only.</strong><br />
	</li>
	<li>These rules are subject to change any time during the duration of the contest, with or without notice, and such changes will be posted on the official contest website. </li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>How are the Winners Decided?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The community will decide the winners. Once the submission deadline (Sept. 30th 2008) is reached, all submissions will be made available on the website for the community to download and check out. Then all community members (anyone) will be able to vote for the submission(s) they like the most. The submissions with the most votes, will win prizes.
