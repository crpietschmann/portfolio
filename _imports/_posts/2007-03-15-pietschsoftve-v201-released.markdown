<P>I just posted v2.0.1 of my <A href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">PietschSoft.VE mapping control</A> on CodePlex. It's been just over a week since I released v2.0.0. This new release adds support for Get Route and Polyline functionality. My&nbsp;initial goal to release v2.0.1&nbsp;was 3/19, but as it turns out I finished the main functionality for it early. This fits right inline with my goal to put out small releases often.</P>

<P>Enjoy!</P>
