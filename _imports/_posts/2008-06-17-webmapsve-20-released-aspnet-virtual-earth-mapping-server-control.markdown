<img style="width: 280px; height: 214px" src="/images/postsWebMapsVE20_SampleWebsite_001.png" alt="" hspace="4" width="280" height="214" align="right" />Today, I released <a href="http://simplovation.com/page/webmapsve.aspx">Web.Maps.VE v2.0</a>!! I had originally planned to release it on June 30th, but was able to reach that goal about 2 weeks early, so here we are. Web.Maps.VE v2.0 builds on top of the previous v1.0 release, and adds many new features. 
</p>
<p>
If you aren&#39;t familiar with Web.Maps.VE, it is the industries first ASP.NET Virtual Earth Mapping Server Control. It enables you (the developer) to implement MS Virtual Earth mapping into your ASP.NET web applications by writing only server-side code; there is absolutely no javascript required. It has never been easier to implement MS Virtual Earth mapping. 
</p>
<p>
Some of the key features in <a href="http://simplovation.com/page/webmapsve.aspx">Web.Maps.VE v2.0</a> are: 
</p>
<ul>

<p>
One dependency that v1.0 has, was it was tied to the ASP.NET AjaxControlToolkit since it utilized some of the base classes within that library. Well, v2.0 no longer has a dependency on the ASP.NET AjaxControlToolkit, so you no longer have to worry about keeping your application in sync with the version of the AjaxControlToolkit that Web.Maps.VE requires. 
</p>
<p>
Another very important thing to mention; we have changed the licensing for Web.Maps.VE v2.0. Web.Maps.VE v2.0 now uses a &quot;Per Developer&quot; licensing model, instead of the &quot;Per Website&quot; licensing model that v1.0 used. The Web.Maps.VE v2.0 Single Developer License allows a single developer the ability to develop Web.Maps.VE functionality into any ASP.NET web application they build. The Web.Maps.VE v2.0 component DLL can then ben distributed with any software built using the Single Developer License. This allows you (an individual developer) to use Web.Maps.VE v2.0 in as many ASP.NET web applications as you would like.
