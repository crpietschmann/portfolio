I'm Chris Pietschmann and I have a few life rules, principles and tips that I've shared over the years on my blog. Until now I haven't compiled them into a single list, so I thought I would do that here. The order doesn't really matter all that much as each is fairly equal to the other; except where painfully obvious.

So here's my list:
