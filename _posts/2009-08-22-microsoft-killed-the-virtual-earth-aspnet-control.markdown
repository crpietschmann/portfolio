<p>Yesterday, Chris Pendleton officially announced that the <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2009/08/21/the-future-of-the-virtual-earth-asp-net-control.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Virtual Earth ASP.NET Control is now Dead</a>. Frankly, I&rsquo;ve considered it &ldquo;dead&rdquo; for a long time now since it didn&rsquo;t get updated much, didn&rsquo;t have a completely full feature support, has a few bugs AND you couldn&rsquo;t use it within your applications because it was just a Preview (CTP) anyway.</p>
<p>There are however a few good things to point out in the light of <a href="http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/maps/archive/2009/08/21/the-future-of-the-virtual-earth-asp-net-control.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft killing its Virtual Earth ASP.NET Control</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://simplovation.com" target="_blank">Simplovation Web.Maps.VE Bing Maps ASP.NET AJAX Server Control is Fully Supported and has Regular Updates</a>. Plus you&rsquo;ve always been allowed to use it within your applications, unlike Microsoft&rsquo;s control. </li>
<li>The <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/silverlightmapcontrolCTP" target="_blank">Bing Maps Silverlight Control</a> is &ldquo;The Future&rdquo; for Bing Maps once it finally gets released sometime in the hopefully new future. </li>
<li>And lastly, it looks like John O&rsquo;Brien from <a href="http://www.soulsolutions.com.au/" target="_blank">Soul Solutions</a> is going to be releasing the Microsoft code on <a href="http://bingmapsasp.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">CodePlex</a>; however it will NOT be supported and will most likely NOT have regular updates. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you were previously a fan of Microsoft&rsquo;s control, then I recommend you check out the <a href="http://simplovation.com" target="_blank">Simplovation Web.Maps.VE</a> control. The licensing cost of the Simplovation control is <a href="http://simplovation.com/buynow/#Web.Maps.VE%202.0">fairly low</a> and sold on a &ldquo;per developer&rdquo; basis. A single developer can purchase a single license and then use the <a href="http://simplovation.com">Simplovation Web.Maps.VE</a> control within as many (unlimited) applications as he wants/needs. Plus, the <a href="http://simplovation.com">Simplovation Web.Maps.VE</a> component can be redistributed along with any of those applications royalty free.</p>

<p><em>Update 8/23/2009: John has created the </em><a href="http://codeplex.com" target="_blank"><em>CodePlex</em></a><em> project to contain the source code for Microsoft&rsquo;s control. </em><a title="http://bingmapsasp.codeplex.com/" href="http://bingmapsasp.codeplex.com/"><em>http://bingmapsasp.codeplex.com/</em></a></p>
