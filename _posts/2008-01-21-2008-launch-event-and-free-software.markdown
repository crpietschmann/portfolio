<p>On February 27th in Los Angeles, CA, Microsoft is kicking off a series of "<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/heroeshappenhere/register/default.mspx">HEROES happen {here}</a>" launch events nationwide. These are the official launch events for Windows Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008, and SQL Server 2008. And, one of the best parts is everyone that takes part in one of the events will be taking home a promotional kit with versions of all three products.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;the Milwaukee event isn't until May 8th, I've registered for the Chicago event on March 11th. I don't want to wait that long!</p>
