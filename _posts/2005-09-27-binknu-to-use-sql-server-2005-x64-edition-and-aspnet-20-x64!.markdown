I just got an email alert today, My favorite <a title="Microsoft" href="http://Microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> related news site, <A href="http://bink.nu">http://bink.nu</A>, will be launching a redesign of their site along with a new server to host it. This is one of the first large sites that I've heard of switching to <a title="ASP.NET" href="http://asp.net" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a> 2.0 and SQL Server 2005. I can't wait to see the new site.

Read the email alert below:
