<p>Friday night, two days ago, the <a href="http://wi-ineta.org">Wisconsin .NET Users Group </a>held a dinner to thank some of the most active and influential people in the community. I was lucky enough to get invited because I&rsquo;m one of the more active Bloggers in the users group. The dinner offered the chance to enjoy live local music, learn more about the WI .NET Users Group and meet/talk with the speakers that would be presenting at Deeper in .NET 2006. How could I pass on this great opportunity?</p>
<p>Well, since I&rsquo;m sort of shy and not that social, I didn&rsquo;t end up talking with very many people that night. This is something I&rsquo;m trying to change; after all I did go to the dinner instead of just staying home. I also brought one of my co-workers along.</p>
<p>We were able to meet and talk with <a href="http://computerzen.com">Scott Hanselman</a> for a few minutes. I asked him what it was like to be so well known (in the .NET world) and be sort of a &ldquo;.NET Rock Star.&rdquo; He basically replied by saying he&rsquo;s just a developer like you or I who talks louder. (He was going to stand up on a chair to demonstrate this but there weren&rsquo;t any close by.)</p>
<p>It's really neat to meet the people who author some of the books, blogs and/or podcasts you listen to or read.</p>
