When you think about it, the three major Operating System's (Linux, MacOS and Windows) come down to one person/entity that controls them. No matter which Operating System you use, you are relying on a single person/entity to update/maintain your platform.

Linus Torvalds controls the <a title="Linux" href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a> kernel.

Microsoft Corp. controls Windows.

Apple Computer, Inc. controls MacOS.

If the person/entity who governs the core of your OS falls off the face of the Earth, at least with <a title="Linux" href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a> we all have the source code for the kernel and can take over where Linus left off. But then again how often does a giant fall of the face of the Earth???

My main point is that we all rely heavily on the person/entity that controls which ever OS we use everyday.
