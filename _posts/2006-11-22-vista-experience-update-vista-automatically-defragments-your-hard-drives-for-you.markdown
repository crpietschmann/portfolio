<p>I guess this is one of the changes they made to always keep Windows running smoothly.</p>
<p>When Windows Vista is installed it automatically sets up a schedule to defragment your hard drives once a week. You no longer need to remember to defrag your hard drives once in awhile in order to keep your system running efficiently.</p>
<p>Now, this is a feature that I was a little surprised they didn't add in XP, but I'm glad it's here in Vista. One thing I always thought was a little interesting is if you check the&nbsp;"Disk Defragmenter" just after a fresh Windows XP install, it will always say you should defragment the drive.</p>
<p>I have the <a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=23&amp;PFid=23&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false#AC">Vista x64 Realtek AC'97 audio drivers </a>installed; so my sound works now. I think these are beta drivers so we'll see how they do. I'll have to check every once in a while for updated drivers.</p>
<p>I also have all my software installed and everything seems to be working perfectly.</p>
