Today, I was introduced to <a href="http://hundredpushups.com/">hundredpushups.com</a>, via a <a href="http://twitter.com/shanselman/statuses/873898459">Tweet by Scott Hanselman</a>. In short, the One Hundred Pushups training program is a simple program that requires about 30 minutes a week of exercise doing pushups, with the goal of working up to being able to do 100 consecutive pushups at the end of the 6 weeks program. This is such a simple program, it's free, and there isn't much easier than doing pushups.

<h3>What is the hundred pushup program?</h3>

Here's a quote from the website:

*If you're serious about increasing your strength, follow this six week training program and you'll soon be on your way to completing 100 consecutive push ups!*

*Think there's no way ***you*** could do this? I think you can! All you need is a good plan, plenty of discipline and about 30 minutes a week to achive this goal!*

*No doubt some of you can already do 50 consecutive push ups, but let's face it, you're in a big minority. Most of you reading this won't even be able to manage 20 pushups. Actually, I'm sure many of you can't even do 10.*

*However, it really doesn't matter which group you fall into. If you follow the progressive push ups training program, I'm positive you'll soon be able to do 100 push ups!*

 
<h3>My Initial Test 
</h3>

I did the initial test today and was able to do 30 pushups. As I remember, I haven't been able to do many more consecutive pushups than this, even in high school when I did some light weight lifting for a little while. I started some other light weight lifting today as well, and I am planning to do other regular exercise (like walking, biking, etc.) and eat a little better as well. I actually went on my first 5 mile bike ride in 2 years the other day. I had to pump the tires up on my bike first of course.

I'll post my results of the One Hundred Pushups program here to keep you updated, and possibly help remind you to do it too.

So... How many pushups can you do? I encourage you to take the challenge.
