<A href="http://www.microsoft.com/business/launch2007/signup/default.mspx">FREE copy of Microsoft Office Professional 2007 and Microsoft Office Groove 2007 when you attend a Windows Vista, 2007 Microsoft Office system, and Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 launch event!</A>

The luanch events are happening between Jan. 16th and Feb. 26th; so be sure not to miss the one nearest you.

Now this is pretty cool! Microsoft seems to be building a reputation of giving away some of their big products for Free at their respective launch events. They have also done this back in 2005 with both the Visual Studio 2005 Standard and SQL Server 2005 Standard products. It's too bad they don't do this with Windows Vista.
