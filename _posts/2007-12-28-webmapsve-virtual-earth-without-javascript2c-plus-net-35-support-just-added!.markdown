<p>
Yesterday, I released the fourth update release (v1.00.04) of my <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">Web.Maps.VE</a> component. The main feature addition in this update is the addition of .NET 3.5 support. 
</p>
<p>
Below is an overview of the main features of <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">Web.Maps.VE</a>. For more information you can go here: <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx</a> 
</p>
<h3>Implement Virtual Earth completely from server-side .NET code; No JavaScript Necessary</h3>
<p>
In case you&#39;re not familiar, <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">Web.Maps.VE is an ASP.NET AJAX Virtual Earth Mapping Server Control</a>. It abstracts out the need to write JavaScript when implementing Virtual Earth mapping within an ASP.NET application. Web.Maps.VE allows you to focus more of your time on implementing features that users want, rather than having to deal with the hassles of JavaScript. 
</p>
<p>
The Sample website that comes with the control has an example of a dynamic/interactive map search implemented without any JavaScript code. This is functionality that would traditionally take hours or even days to write using Virtual Earth and JavaScript directly, and you can do it in a matter of minutes using <a href="http://simplovation.com/Page/WebMapsVE.aspx">Web.Maps.VE</a>! 
</p>
<p>
You can even handle Virtual Earth map events (such as: onclick,) from within server-side code. 
</p>
<h3>Can you still use JavaScript if necessary?</h3>
<p>
Yes, Web.Maps.VE also has a JavaScript API so there&#39;s no limit to the custom mapping features that can be implemented. If there&#39;s a feature you need to implement that isn&#39;t easily done using only Server-Side .NET code, then you can still implement it directly&nbsp;in JavaScript. And, the best part is Web.Maps.VE utilizes the&nbsp;ASP.NET AJAX Extensions, so you can write JavaScript code to interact with the map that is object oriented and&nbsp;event driven! 
</p>
