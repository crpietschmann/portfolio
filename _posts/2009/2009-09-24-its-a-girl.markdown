<!-- more -->

Some of you that follow my blog may have noticed that it’s been almost a month since I’ve really posted anything. I know I’ve done this in the past when I’ve been busy working on other things (mostly to get paid), but this time it’s for an entirely different reason…  
My wife and I had a beautiful baby girl! And, we’ve been adjusting to our new sleep schedule of only getting 2-4 hours of sleep maximum at a time. Anyone with kids understands how it is with a newborn, and now only after having one do I fully understand. After all, I was sleeping way too much before anyway.  
Things have been going absolutely wonderful!  
I’m still trying to figure out how I’m going to have enough time to keep on blogging and learning now that I have most of my time dedicated elsewhere. One thing I don’t want to do is completely disappear from the web, like I’ve seen other tech bloggers do after a major personal life change such as this. So, I’ll just keep on blogging here and there, and maybe I’ll still be able to improve the quality of my posts.  
Thanks!
