<P>If this guy really doesn't want to be sensored then he needs to go pay a hosting provider to host his own website. Then he can blog about what ever he wants. I host my blog on my own website because I know I can trust myself to not victimize myself&nbsp;with political concerns.</P>
<P>Read the story:<BR><A href="http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2006/01/microsoft_takes.html">http://rconversation.blogs.com/rconversation/2006/01/microsoft_takes.html</A><BR><A href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/01/03/microsoft-takes-down-chinese-blogger-my-opinions-on-that/">http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/01/03/microsoft-takes-down-chinese-blogger-my-opinions-on-that/</A></P>
<P>MSN&nbsp;really has two options:<BR>1) get MSN blocked by the Chinese government<BR>2) sensor the blogs of Chinese citizens.</P>
<P>The best business choice would be option #2. The best moral option may be option #1. This is quite a delema for MSN. Who wants to be cut off to potintially&nbsp;over 1 Billion&nbsp;of the worlds population? That's just not good for business. I think the less risky method is to sensor Chinese blogs.</P>
