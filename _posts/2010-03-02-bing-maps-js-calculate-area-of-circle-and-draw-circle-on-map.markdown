<p>Something that can be usefull at times in being able to calculate the total Area of a circle, especially when plotting it on a map. So, I decided to slightly modify my "<a href="http://pietschsoft.com/post/2008/02/09/Virtual-Earth-Draw-a-Circle-Radius-Around-a-LatLong-Point.aspx">Draw a Circle Radius Around Lat/Lng Point</a>" to make it also calculate the Area of the circles and display that value within the TItle of the Circle Shapes Pushpin.</p>
<p>Remember, back in Trig class, it's fairly simple to calculate the area of a circle. You just Multiply Pi by the Radius Squared.</p>
<p><em>Area = Pi * (radius * radius)</em></p>
<p>Anyway, I know this isn't a very advanced math problem. If fact it's much simpler than calculating out the point that make up the circle in the first place. However, I thought I'd post it since it may be usefull to someone that maybe doesn't quite remember this little trick from Trig class.</p>
<p>Here's the full, modified source code that contains this:</p>
