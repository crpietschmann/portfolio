<P>I know 802.11b and g both use 2.4Ghz frequency range, which is the same as a Microwave Oven. Now the question is, could you basically turn up the power on your router to the point that it would be able to cook food?</P>
<P>I know technically (if this were possible) the components inside the router aren't made to withstand handling that much power. But, what if?</P>
<P>Microwave = Cooked Food</P>
<P>WiFi + Power =&nbsp;Cooked Food????</P>
