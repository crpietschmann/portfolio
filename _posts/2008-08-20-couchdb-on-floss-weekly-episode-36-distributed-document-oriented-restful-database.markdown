<p>
I just listened to the latest episode of <a href="http://twit.tv/FLOSS">FLOSS Weekly</a>; <a href="http://twit.tv/floss36">episode 36 on CouchDB</a>. This episode is an interview with <a href="http://jan.prima.de/">Jan Lehnardt</a> about <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/">CouchBD</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s a description of what CouchDB is from their website:
</p>
<p>
<em>Apache CouchDB is a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free
document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API. Among other
features, it provides robust, incremental replication with bi-directional
conflict detection and resolution, and is queryable and indexable using a
table-oriented view engine with JavaScript acting as the default view
definition language.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>CouchDB is written in <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, but can be easily accessed from any
environment that provides means to make HTTP requests. There are a multitude of
third-party client libraries that make this even easier for a variety of
programming languages and environments.</em>
</p>
<p>
I haven&#39;t installed or tested it out, but it looks like a really cool idea for a small efficient database design. I always find it interesting to hear about some of these cool &quot;new&quot; projects that look at everyday problems in new and different ways.
