Today is the first day of Spring, and in the Milwaukee area we are lucky enough to have some rain and a thunderstorm today. I like thunderstorms so I'm glad the season is here. The only bad part is it's also the beginning of Tornado season.

<STRONG>Update 4/15/2007:</STRONG> And, it also snowed about an inch a couple days ago. But, it seems to be getting warmer again... But, we'll see if it stays warm. You gotta love Wisconsin weather.
