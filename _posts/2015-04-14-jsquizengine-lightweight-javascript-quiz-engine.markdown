<p>I've been <a href="http://blogs.perficient.com/microsoft/2015/04/become-a-microsoft-certified-specialist-with-html5-js-css3/">studying for some Microsoft certification exams lately</a>. The exam I'm studying for right now is the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-532.aspx">Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions (70-532) exam</a> and this exam doesn't have any practice tests available from anyone. So I've decided to make my own practice test questions for it. However, I've been unable to find any nice, clean, simple test / quiz engines to be able to take the practice questions like a semi-real test. So I decided to build my own using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
<p>The resulting test / quiz engine is&nbsp;my new <a href="https://github.com/crpietschmann/jsquizengine">jsQuizEngine </a>project. It's a simple, clean quiz engine that's easy to use. The<a href="https://github.com/crpietschmann/jsQuizEngine/blob/master/src/quiz/default.htm"> file format for the&nbsp;quizzes is even in HTML</a>, so it's even easy to create new quizzes for.</p>

<p>Also, here's some screenshots of where it's at so far. Keep in mind this project is really simple at this point, but it does work.</p>
