<p>
How do you spend your lunch time at work? Since I need to take a break away from work, I usually just surf, read up on the latest news (<a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, <a href="http://dotnetkicks.com">DotNetKicks</a>), and check my personal email. So, I&#39;ve come up with a way to make my lunch time more productive. And I&#39;m calling it... <strong><a href="/download/lunchtimecoder">Lunch Time Coder</a>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>What is Lunch Time Coder?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href="/download/lunchtimecoder">Lunch Time Coder</a> is my new initiative to make my lunch time more productive. I&#39;ll take one idea each day and turn it into a usable component or program during my lunch time. I know that 30 - 60 minutes isn&#39;t much time to get a whole lot done, but all components and programs I write will be short, to the point, and just plain work. There may also be days where I spend time enhancing something that was done on a previous day.
</p>
<p>
This idea is my simple adaptation of the <a href="http://anappaday.com">AnAppADay.com</a> idea.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you have an idea for a small component or program?</strong>
</p>
<p>
If so, please let me know what it is, and it&#39;ll help me not run out of ideas. You can either <a href="/contact.aspx">email it to me through the Contect section of my website</a>, or just submit it as a comment to this post.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what little gems I can turn out of this little experiment. And, if it goes well (as I&#39;m sure it will), I&#39;ll have a very productive way to spend my lunch time each day.
</p>
