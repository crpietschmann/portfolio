<P><A title=Microsoft href="http://Microsoft.com" target=_blank>Microsoft</A> has announced the new Microsoft Certified Architect Program (MCAP). The goal of the MCAP is to identify the top industry experts in IT Architecture. This is a very high level certification.</P>
<P>The certification process has 8 steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The Microsoft Certified Architect candidate is expected to have at least 10 years of verifiable experience as a practicing architect prior to applying for the program 
<LI>The candidate applies for acceptance into the program by: 
<UL>
<LI>Contacting Microsoft directly (via the Microsoft.com web site) during an open enrollment period 
<LI>Being referred by his or her employer 
<LI>Being referred by an existing Microsoft Certified Architect or Microsoft Certified Architect Review Board member </LI></UL>
<LI>The candidate&#8217;s application is screened for the necessary work experience 
<LI>Upon verification of experience, the candidate is accepted into the program and assigned a program mentor 
<LI>In addition to a program mentor, the candidate is given access to a library of self-paced technical and non-technical content to assist them in the preparation of their solution 
<LI>The candidate submits his or her solution to the Review Board in preparation for formal presentation to the Board. 
<LI>The candidate attends the Review Board Meeting and presents his or her solution to the Review Board members. Upon conclusion of the presentation, the candidate fields a series of questions about his solution and presentation from the Review Board 
<LI>After the formal presentation and a positive vote from the Review Board, the candidate is awarded the Microsoft Certified Architect credential </LI></OL>
<P>I think this is a great move. This cert will single out the best of the best in IT Solution Architecture. However, I don't really agree with the initial requirement of 10 years of verifiable experience as a practicing architect prior to applying. I think they should maybe recomend 10 years but require maybe say 5 year of experience. Someone with&nbsp;10 years of experience could be at the same level as someone with 5 years of experience. Everybody learns at different rates (I'm not complaining about the requirements because I want to apply for it now.) I wouldn't want to see someone have to wait 5 more years to be able to be accepted into the program just because (even though they are qualified) they only have 5 years of expereince.</P>
<P>Who knows, maybe some day I'll become MCAP certified.</P>
