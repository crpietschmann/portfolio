<p>Today, I put out v1.01 update release to the <a href="http://jslinq.com">LINQ to JavaScript (JSLINQ)</a> Project. This update adds even more LINQ functionality; to view a list of what't been added go <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/JSLINQ/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=10315">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on adding some cool things to JSLINQ that will make their way into the next couple releases. Among these are&nbsp;a small JSLINQ Interactive SDK that will make its way into the next release, and some performance enhancements that&nbsp;<a href="http://brennan.offwhite.net/blog/">Brennan Stehling</a>&nbsp;suggested.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions for this project, please let me know, please post them to the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/JSLINQ/Thread/List.aspx">Discussion Board</a> or <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/JSLINQ/WorkItem/List.aspx">Issue Tracker</a>.</p>
