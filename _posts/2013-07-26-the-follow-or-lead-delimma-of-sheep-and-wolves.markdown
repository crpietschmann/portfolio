<p>To follow or lead; that is the question.</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, people in our society are constantly following in one capacity or another.</p>
<p>However, there are a few people that stand out / take risks / try new things. These are the leaders, the entrepreneurs, the wolves.</p>
<p>Without&nbsp;wolves the&nbsp;sheep would never discover any innovation, and the world would stagnate.</p>
<p>Are you a Sheep or a Wolf?</p>
