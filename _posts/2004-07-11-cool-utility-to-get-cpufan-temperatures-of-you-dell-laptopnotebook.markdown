Dell Inspiron 8x00 fan control utility by Christian Diefer

I don&#39;t know why DELL doesn&#39;t have a utility you can use to read the CPU/Fan Temperatures of you DELL Laptop. I have an Inspiron 1100 and this little utility works perfectly. It even allows you to control the Fan speed.

Get It Here: <a href="http://www.diefer.de/i8kfan/index.html">http://www.diefer.de/i8kfan/index.html</a>

He even has a command prompt version you can use. There is a full compatibility list of all the DELL Notebooks that this utility will work with.

I have to say, Great Job Christian!
