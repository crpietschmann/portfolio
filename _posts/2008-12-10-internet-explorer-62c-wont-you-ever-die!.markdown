<a href="http://iedeathmarch.org"><img src="/images/posts/iedeathmarch2009badge.png" border="0" alt="IE DEATH MARCH 2009" align="right" /></a>I&#39;ve come across the <a href="http://iedeathmarch.org">http://iedeathmarch.org</a> website a couple times recently, and I definately agree.



And I quote from the site:



*&quot;Internet Explorer 6 will be SEVEN years old on August 27th [2008]. It came out a few weeks before the Twin Towers fell. It came out before the Nintendo GameCube. It came out before the first iPod.<br />
It&#39;s time to put a deadline on dropping IE6, and I say that time is now, and the deadline should be soon... say like, March 2009. That&#39;s roughly a little more than 6 months.&quot; *



The goes on to list a few other things that are Younger than IE6. Some of which are:

<ul>
	<li>Google Adsense</li>
	<li>XBox (the original XBox)</li>
	<li>Nintendo GameCube</li>
	<li>Hummer H2</li>
</ul>


And (I think the most notable is...), WINDOWS XP IS YOUNGER THAN IE6! Windows XP?!? There&#39;s been 2 versions of windows (XP and Vista) released in the over 7 years since IE6 was released. Not to mention the fact that IE7 was released about 2 years ago, and IE8 is on the horizon.



C&#39;mon people, stop using IE6. If you have Windows XP you can upgrade to IE7.
