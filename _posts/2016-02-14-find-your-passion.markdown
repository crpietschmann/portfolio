Much of success in life hinges on finding something you're passionate about. Sure, certain interests that turn into passions can be difficult to build a career around, but there's certainly ways to do it. No matter what your passion, you need to find it!

Once you find your passion, you need to figure out how you can exploit that to build a career. What ever your passion may be, you will be able to find something related to it that you can build a career around.

Building a successful career around a passion will be hard. it will take time. It will require you to never give up! It also may require you to make certain sacrifices, as nothing worthwhile pursuing comes without risk.

If you aren't really believing me that any passion can be turned into a career, then please think about the following examples:
<ul>
<li>If your ultimate passion is Fitness, then you could 1) open a gym, 2) become a personal fitness coach, 3) write books, 4) design fitness equipment</li>
<li>If your ultimate passion is Fishing, then you could 1) design lures to sell, 2) do guided fishing tours, 3) start or work at a sporting goods store</li>
<li>If your ultimate passion is Programming, then you could 1) start a freelance programming business, 2) build apps for iOS, Android, etc, 3) create training videos, 4) write books</li>
</ul>

The above examples are just a small limited few. In reality there is almost unlimited potential to build a career around any passion in life.

When you find your passion, you will find your direction. Once you have a direction, you will be able to set goals and then design plans to make those goals a reality.

Anyone can make plans and work towards them, but only those fueled by their passions truly have what it takes to persevere and obtain the success dreamed of.
