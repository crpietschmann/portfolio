I&#39;m not sure how many apps out there are still on Virtual Earth v2, but Microsoft has announced that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/virtualearth/archive/2008/02/04/virtual-earth-version-2-being-deprecated.aspx">Virtual Earth v2 will be depricated on March 31st</a>. So, if your app is still on VE v2, you better get working to upgrade it to VE v6 before v2 is turned off. Also, it&#39;s worth noting that there are a few breaking differences between v2 and v6, so it may take a little while to upgrade your app.
