I just finished migrating my blog over to use <a href="http://dotnetblogengine.net">BlogEngine.NET</a>. The process was very painless. I only had to do two things: 1) write a sql script to import my posts/comments/tags from my old blog into BlogEngine, and 2) setup some redirect pages to redirect traffic to the new urls.

Now, I just need to find or create a better theme to use.
