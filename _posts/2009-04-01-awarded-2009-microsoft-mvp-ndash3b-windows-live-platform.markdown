<p><em><strong>Congratulations 2009 Microsoft MVP!</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Dear Chris Pietschmann,</em></p>
<p><em>Congratulations! We are pleased to present you with the 2009 Microsoft&reg; MVP Award! This award is given to exceptional technical community leaders who actively share their high quality, real world expertise with others.</em></p>
<p><em>The Microsoft MVP Award provides us the unique opportunity to celebrate and honor your significant contributions and say "Thank you for your technical leadership."</em></p>
<p><em>Toby Richards     <br />General Manager       <br />Community Support Services</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be one of the April Fools MVPs. Last year I wasn&rsquo;t sure at first if the email was an April Fools joke or not, and this year I&rsquo;m just as happy that it&rsquo;s not. This marks the second time I&rsquo;ve been awarded Microsoft MVP. Last year I was awarded in the &ldquo;Virtual Earth&rdquo; category, and last fall they renamed me to &ldquo;Windows Live Platform&rdquo;. This year I am awarded in the same &ldquo;Windows Live Platform&rdquo; category.</p>

<p>And Congratulations to all those that have also been awarded MVP on this April Fools day. Especially to those who&rsquo;ve gotten awarded for the first time; keep it up.</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>
