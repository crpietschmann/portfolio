<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx">Scott Guthrie</a> announced on his blog today, that Microsoft will be releasing the source code for .NET 3.5 as shared source under the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/referencelicense.mspx">Microsoft Reference License (MS-RL)</a>. You will also be able to enable debugging support within Visual Studio 2008 for the .NET Framework.</p>
<p>This is really cool. I have always used .NET Reflector to peek into the source of the framework, but now I'll actually be able to look at the code itself.</p>
