**Update (11/7/2007):** This control is now located here: <a href="http://codeplex.com/pietschsoftve3">http://codeplex.com/pietschsoftve3</a>

I just uploaded a new release (v0.02) of my ASP.NET 2.0 Virtual Earth v3 Server Control. The download contains a Visual Studio 2005 solution that contains the source code for the server control dll and a sample website that uses the control. The only new feature in this release is full ViewState support. I do plan on adding many more features to this control as I get time to work on it. Enjoy!
