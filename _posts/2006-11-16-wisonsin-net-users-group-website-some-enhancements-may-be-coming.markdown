After the last Wisconsin .NET Users Group meeting (on Tuesday) I discussed with Scott and a couple others some potential ideas for enhancing the groups website. Hopefully in not too long, we will be working on a new website for the group.
</p>
<p>
A couple of the ideas we&#39;ve come up with are adding Blogging and/or Forums functionality. These feature sets would allow members to contribute more easily and communicate with one another outside the meetings.
