A couple weeks ago, while attending the Heros Happen Here launch event in Milwaukee, I ran into Larry Clarkin who is co-host of The Thirsty Developer, and we recorded <a href="http://thirstydeveloper.com/2008/05/28/TheThirstyDeveloper23TheVirtualEarthEdition.aspx">The Virtual Earth Edition episode</a> that he just released today. In the podcast, I talk about how I got into Virtual Earth development, and give a good overview of the Virtual Earth product, among other things VE related, including the <a href="http://codeplex.com/VEJS">Virtual Earth JavaScript Intellisense Helper</a> and my <a href="http://simplovation.com/page/webmapsve.aspx">Web.Maps.VE</a> product.
