<p>The Internet Explorer shortcut in the Quick Launch toolbar and in the Start menu of Vista x64 will run the 32-bit version of Internet Explorer by default. Why run the 32-bit version if IE on the 64-bit version of Vista?</p>
<p>There are actually two shortcuts for Internet Explorer in the "All Programs" menu. Why two and what's the difference?</p>
<p>Here's the title of each and the exe's they run:</p>
<p>Internet Explorer<br />"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</p>
<p>Internet Explorer (64-bit)<br />"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</p>
<p>The first one runs IE from the "Program Files (x86)" folder, this is the 32-bit version. The second one is the 64-bit version.</p>
<p><strong>How do I make the Quick Launch shortcut run the 64-bit version of IE?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-Click the Shortcut</li>
<li>Click "Properties"</li>
<li>On the Shortcut tab, replace the content of the "Target" textbox with the target from the "Internet Explorer (64-bit)" shortcut in the "All Programs" menu.</li>
<li>Happy surfing via IE 64-bit</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Are there any gotchas to running the 64-bit version of IE?</strong></p>
<p>Actually there is one that I know of. At the time I'm posting this there is no 64-bit version of Flash Player. So, if you need to view a website that uses Flash, then you'll need to use the 32-bit version IE; at least for now. I'm sure Adobe will release a 64-bit version of Flash Player by the end of January when Vista ships to consumers. But then again, maybe not since Vista x64 runs 32-bit IE by default.</p>
<p>I wonder what other oddities like this are hidden within Vista.</p>
