<P>I've been looking at the code of <A href="http://dotnetblogengine.net">BlogEngine.NET</A> and playing around with it a bit lately, so I decided to create a theme to see how easy it is. And, it is actually really simple to do.</P>
<P>I actually used the Cogitation theme as the basis and just morphed it into the below theme I call SimpleBlack. If you would like to use it, go ahead.</P>
