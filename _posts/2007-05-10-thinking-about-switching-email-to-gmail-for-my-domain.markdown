When <A href="http://www.google.com/a/smallbiz/">GMail for My Doma</A>in was first available I set it up for SlapDev.com to test it out. It was really simple to setup and you get the benefit of the regular GMail web client for reading your emails. It's pretty neat.

I'm thinking about moving my email hosting for PietschSoft.com over to <A href="http://www.google.com/a/smallbiz/">GMail for My Domain</A>. Have any of you been using it? Could you give me some feedback on your experiences?
