<P>There is now a web version of MSN Messenger.&nbsp;Pretty neet, I think. I like the idea of a web application working and acting just like a windows application. The current Web Messenger isn't as feature full as the Windows application, but I would imagine they are working on it, since it is still in Beta.</P>
<P>Check it out at <A href="http://WebMessenger.MSN.com">http://WebMessenger.MSN.com</A>&nbsp;</P>
<P>System Requirements: 
<LI>A web browser: Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or later, Netscape 7.0 or later, or Mozilla 1.6 or later, running in Microsoft Windows. 
<LI>An Internet connection (56 Kbps or faster recommended) 
<LI>A Microsoft .NET Passport. If you have a hotmail.com or msn.com account, you already have a Passport. 
<LI>Popups enabled for this web site if you are using popup blocker software like the MSN Toolbar or if you have Windows XP SP2 installed. 
<P><STRONG>Updated 9/25/2007:</STRONG> I thought it may be of interest to add that it doesn't look like MSN Web Messenger is in Beta anymore. However,&nbsp;I haven't used it for a long time so I don't know how long it's been out of Beta. Also, this post has proven to be my most popular post on the blog, it is currently at about 5,000 views over the last month; most of which are clicks through Google. I find this interesting since this is one of my posts that is the most unrelated to the majority of the other content on my blog. I have also removed the screenshots from this post to bring the bandwidth cost of this page down slightly. Thanks for visiting!</P></LI>
