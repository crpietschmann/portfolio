Ok, I got it working by changing the web.config file (forcing a full restart of the <a title="ASP.NET" href="http://asp.net" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a> Application). I guess I'll juat have to do that each time it errors. :(

I'm either going to make my own pblog or use the new Community Server : Blog; I'm undecided...
