**Download.Ject**<BR>Microsoft teams have confirmed a report of a security issue known as Download.Ject affecting customers using Microsoft Internet Explorer, a component of Microsoft Windows. (Download.Ject is also known as: JS.Scob.Trojan, Scob, and JS.Toofeer.)

<A href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/incident/download_ject.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/security/incident/download_ject.mspx</A>

<B>Important</B>  Customers who have deployed Windows XP Service Pack 2 RC2 are not at risk.





Shaweet, I'm not affected!! I have WinXP SP2 RC2 installed. There may seem to be the most security flaws in Internet Explorer, but you have to remember that it is the most widely used web browser and that means it gets attacked the most.
