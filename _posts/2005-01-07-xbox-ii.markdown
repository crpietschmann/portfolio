2) Flash based HD... Yes!!!  It was told to me that the HD was going to be flash based... small size fast access... BAM!

3) No Stupid Dongle DVD playback... Yes!!!  The reason that the first Xbox didn't have built in DVD playback is a simple one, Sony owns the Intellectual Property rights for DVD playback.  Nuf said...
