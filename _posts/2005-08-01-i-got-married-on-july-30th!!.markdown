<P>I know I never mentioned it in past blog entries. The date was picked and it was being planned over the last year. I got married on July 30th. The ceremony was about 30 minutes long, and it took 3 and a half hours to take pictures. Yeah, the the ceremony took one seventh of the time it took to take pictures. I know that's how it usually goes, but it sucks standing all day in what has to be the most uncomfortable, rented pair of shoes. </P>
<P>We were kind of worried it would be too hot or it would rain, but it turned out really nice. It wasn't too hot and it didn't rain. One of the brides assistants sprained her knee at the reception, but there was no need for an ambulance to come. Also (somewhat suprisingly) everyone in the bridal party had a great time and there were no confrontations (by anyone) of&nbsp;a violent nature.</P>
<P>I was not nervous, I just siezed the day and had a blast!</P>
