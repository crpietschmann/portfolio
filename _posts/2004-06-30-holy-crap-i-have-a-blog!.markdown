Hello all you weird and not so weird people out there stuck in spiderman's web. I don't know why anyone would ever want to read my blog, but here we go anyway. If you're a stalker, I guess you'll like my blog since it'll give you a little insight into the inner workings of my so called brain.

All my blogging will be put up here instead of on SlapDev.com like I had initially planned. I am going to save SlapDev.com for putting up development articles and other developer related help. Along with this blog will also come a redesigned PietschSoft.com.
