Unfortunately, it hasn’t been maintained by Microsoft in a long time and is closed sourced. Thankfully, there’s been a movement to finally get Windows Live Writer released as Open Source. Thanks to Scott Hanselman and <a href="http://openlivewriter.org/" target="_blank">MANY others</a>, the all new <a href="http://openlivewriter.org/" target="_blank">Open Live Writer</a> has now been released!

Download it here: <a href="http://openlivewriter.org" target="_blank">http://openlivewriter.org</a> 
The new Open Live Writer is licensed under the MIT License, and the open source project is hosted up on GitHub. Open Live Writer also a project supported by the <a href="http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects" target="_blank">.NET Foundation</a>. 
Lastly, as proof that Open Live Writer works with BlogEngine.NET (the software I use to host this blog,) I have authored and published this post using it. It’s nice to finally be able to use Live Writer again, and I have missed using it. 
P.S. Sorry about the nested, inception screenshot but I just couldn’t help it. <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-top-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-right-style: none" alt="Smile" src="/files/wlEmoticon-smile.png">
