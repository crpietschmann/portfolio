<!-- more -->

While studying for the MCSD: Azure Solutions Architect certification I decided to blog a lot more on all things Azure. Also, instead of posting those posts here, I decided to create a completely new blog site dedicated just to "all things Azure" This new site is <a href="http://build5nines.com" target="_blank">BuildAzure.com</a>. I have also created the @BuildAzure twitter account associated with the new blog.

I will still blog here, as I have for over 10 years so far. However, my posts relating to Microsoft Azure technologies and features will mostly be posted to the new <a href="http://build5nines.com" target="_blank">Build Azure blog</a>. The purpose of the new blog is to have a specific place focusing solely on Microsoft Azure, while my existing / personal blog will still remain for posting other random geek and developer related content as always.
