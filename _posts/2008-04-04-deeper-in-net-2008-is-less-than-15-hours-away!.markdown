<a href="http://deeperin.net" title="Deeper in .NET 2008 by the Wisconsin .NET Users Group">Deeper in .NET 2008</a> is less than a day away. It&#39;s tomorrow already! I am probably more excited about DiDN this year since we didn&#39;t have one last year, but it&#39;s still going to be awesome. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you want to learn about some really awesome stuff?</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong> 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you want to meet and talk with&nbsp;some of the best developers in the community?</strong> 
</p>
<p>
If you said yes to either of the above questions, then you wont want to miss out. If you haven&#39;t signed up yet, that is ok, you can still sign up at <a href="http://deeperin.net/">http://deeperin.net</a>. And remember, it&#39;s FREE! 
</p>
<p>
You wont only be learning about some really awesome stuff or be able to meet and talk with some of the best developers in the community... You may even be able to win FREE stuff (door prizes), or even meet (in person) the presenters. 
</p>
<p>
<strike>There is also an Attendee Party that will be held after the event. I don&#39;t know if you can still register; there is very limited seating at this one. But if you would like to attend this as well, just go to </strike><a href="http://deeperin.net/"><strike>http://deeperin.net</strike></a><strike> and see if you can register.</strike> Never mind registering for the Attendee Party; registration for it is now FULL. But, you can still register for <a href="http://deeperin.net">Deeper in .NET</a>!
</p>
<p>
I can&#39;t wait!
