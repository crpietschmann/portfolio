Time is the scarcest resource we have. More scarce than land, More scarce than water. More scarce than money. This is one of the reasons that life is so precious.

*"A penny saved is a penny earned." - Benjamin Franklin*

This famous quote from Benjamin Franklin can also be applied to Time. We only have so much time. We need to choose wisely how we spend it.

An hour spent reading useless Facebook status updates is one less hour spent with your family.

An hour spent watching TV is one less hour spent reading a book to learn something new.

An hour spent playing video games is one less hour spent bonding with your child.

Choose wisely what you spend your time on. You only have so much left.
