This project looks awesome, now if only I had a WebCam so I could test it out and start playing with it. Anyway, the new Touchless SDK (and it&#39;s Open Source!) brings the ability to have Multi-Touch input within an application without the user needing to actually touch the screen, all with the use of a standard WebCam.
