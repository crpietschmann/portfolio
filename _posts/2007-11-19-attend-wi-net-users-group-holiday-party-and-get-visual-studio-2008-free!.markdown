<p><strong>Update Dec. 11, 2007: </strong>The <a href="/Blog/Post.aspx?PostID=1431">WI .NET Users Group&nbsp;Holiday Party has been cancelled due to weather</a>, and will be rescheduled.</p>
<p>On Dec. 11, 2007, <a href="http://www.wi-ineta.org/holiday">Microsoft is teaming up with the Wisconsin .NET Users Group</a> to throw a special holiday part. There will be Free food and prizes, just like&nbsp;at every other&nbsp;group meeting.</p>
<p>Do you want to get Visual Studio 2008 Free? Just bring in your computer and install it at the party. Those that install VS'08 at the party will get a full licensed copy of Visual Studio 2008 mailed to them within a couple weeks. This is so awesome; I know I'll be bringing my laptop! I wonder how many people who don't have laptops will be bringing in their desktops? C'mon don't be shy...</p>
<p>The full details of the party have yet to be announced, but make sure you <a href="http://www.wi-ineta.org/holiday">go register for the meeting</a>. And, remember membership to the Wisconsin .NET Users Group is Free!</p>
