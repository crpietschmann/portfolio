<p>
Have you got a cool piece of code you wrote, but don&#39;t know what to do with?<br />
Have you got a cool idea, but need the motivation to work on it?<br />
Would you like an MSDN Subscription, but don&#39;t have the money to pay for it?
</p>
<p>
If you can answer, &quot;YES&quot; to any of the above questions, then you should definitely submit an entry in the Community Coding Contest by midnight September 30, 2008! 
</p>
<p>
As of today, there are 58 days left to submit your entries in the <a href="http://communitycodingcontest.org/">Community Coding Contest</a>. There are more prizes than just two MSDN Premium Subscriptions with Visual Studio Team System 2008 Suite being given away; a few companies have donated additional prizes too! View the Prizes page for a full list of the prizes being given away. Also, if we get a ton of entries, we may be able to get more prizes donated!
</p>
<p>
Once the entry phase of the contest is finished, the website will be opened up for the community to vote on the winners. We aren&#39;t going to have a panel of judges that might give the prizes to people they know. YOU the community are going to be in charge to judging the contest, on any criteria you want, to decide who wins these awesome prizes! 
</p>
<p>
I&#39;m anxious to see what cool intries get submitted over the next two months!
