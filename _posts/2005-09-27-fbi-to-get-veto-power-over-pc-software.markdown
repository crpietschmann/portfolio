<P>There's&nbsp;no way they'll be able to keep me or anyone else from writing software and distributing it.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I think software (like speech or text) qualifies under the 1st amendment. I can say or write what ever I want with out being punishable by law. Someone listening to my speech or reading my letter is no different than running my software.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Even if somehow this would get passed, there is no way they'd be able to enforce it. Even if they were able to legally get <a title="Microsoft" href="http://Microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> and Apple to make their OS's only run &#8220;approved&#8220; software, there is no way they'll be able to get <a title="Linux" href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a> to do the same. But I suppose then they'd make <a title="Linux" href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a> be &#8220;unapproved.&#8220; The next logical alternative will be to make computer BIOS authors add this crappy logic to the BIOS so that only &#8220;approved&#8220; OS's would be able to run. This would open up all sorts of software and hardware hacks that would re-enable free speech in the Information age.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>We must stand up for our rights and make sure our voices are heard!<o:p></o:p></P>
