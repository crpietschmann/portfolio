There is a Free Open Source alternative to MS-Office. Open Office is a professional quality application suite unlike most of the open source projects I've seen. It has all the features of MS-Office and you can even open and save all the MS Document Formats. Open Office even has a couple really neat features that MS-Office doesn't have: Writer can save to PDF and Impress can save SWF (Macromedia Flash). It is currently at Version 1.1, and 2.0 is currently in development. I haven't looked very indepth at the features of this suite, but I am very impressed with it being Free Open Source and all.
