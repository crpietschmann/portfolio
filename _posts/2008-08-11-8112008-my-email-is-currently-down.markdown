Update: Ok, my email is back and working again. 



FYI, for anyone trying to email me, my email is currently down, so I wont see your messages until it&#39;s back up. The issue is actually GMail. I use GMail Apps for your domain to host my email (both pietschsoft.com and simplovation.com) email address&#39;s, and currently their service is down. I don&#39;t know if everyones is out, but mine is. I&#39;ll post an update when it&#39;s back, and reply to all emails as soon as I can too. This is actually the first time GMail has been down for me with all my email address&#39;s.
