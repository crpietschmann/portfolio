I received notice this morning that I have been awarded Microsoft MVP in the Azure expertise category. It's been a few years since I wasn't renewed as a *Bing Maps MVP*, and it feels great to be recognized for the work I've been doing with <https://BuildAzure.com>, the [Milwaukee Azure meetup group](http://mkeazure.com), and other online and offline community contributions. This is certainly a great way to ring in the new year.

**Happy New Year! And, congratulations to all other renewed and newly awarded MVPs!**

*P.S. I first posted this saying "2016". Oh boy, it's so easy to type/write the old yer at the beginning of a new year. Happy new year!!*
