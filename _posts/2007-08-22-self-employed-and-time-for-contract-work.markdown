<!-- more -->
<P>I have decided to go out on my own and work full time getting my own business off the ground. It's going to be an exciting ride and I know I have what it takes to make it work. I'll be working on a few project ideas that I have (<EM>If you want to find out more info about what I'm working on, you'll just have to watch this blog for more&nbsp;info as it's posted.</EM>)</P>
<P>As a result, I will also&nbsp;have time to do consulting on a contract basis. I have 6+ years of software development experience using MS .NET Framework 1.x/2.0 doing both Windows Forms and ASP.NET development along with SQL Server 2000/2005, JavaScript/AJAX and more. I am willing to work on site only if your office is within a reasonable distance from my home (<EM>Milwaukee area</EM>), otherwise I am more than willing to work remotely.</P>
<P>If you are interested in hiring my services to work on a contract basis, please&nbsp;<A href="/Contact.aspx">email me via the contact form on my website</A>.</P>
