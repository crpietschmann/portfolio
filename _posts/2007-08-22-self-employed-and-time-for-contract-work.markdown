<!-- more -->

I have decided to go out on my own and work full time getting my own business off the ground. It's going to be an exciting ride and I know I have what it takes to make it work. I'll be working on a few project ideas that I have (*If you want to find out more info about what I'm working on, you'll just have to watch this blog for more info as it's posted.*)

As a result, I will also have time to do consulting on a contract basis. I have 6+ years of software development experience using MS .NET Framework 1.x/2.0 doing both Windows Forms and ASP.NET development along with SQL Server 2000/2005, JavaScript/AJAX and more. I am willing to work on site only if your office is within a reasonable distance from my home (*Milwaukee area*), otherwise I am more than willing to work remotely.

If you are interested in hiring my services to work on a contract basis, please <A href="/Contact.aspx">email me via the contact form on my website</A>.
