<p>A few weeks ago I built and released <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-in/app/simple-weight-log/e369e5bb-e363-4ada-a479-07ff60c85b6c">Simple Weight Log</a> (my first Windows 8 app in the store.) The app allows you to enter your weight in a log by date and it charts the different weigh-ins in a line graph to allow you to easily visualize weight changes over time.</p>  <p><a href="ms-windows-store:PDP?PFN=SimplovationLLC.SimpleWeightLog_zambmtj2152mm">View in Windows Store</a></p>  <p><a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-in/app/simple-weight-log/e369e5bb-e363-4ada-a479-07ff60c85b6c"><img title="Simple Weight Log" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="Simple Weight Log App Screenshot" src="http://pietschsoft.com/image.axd?picture=SimpleWeightLogScreenshot_20130313_1.jpg" width="244" height="139" /></a></p>  <p><em>“Are you trying to loose weight? or, gain weight? If so, then Simple Weight Log will allow you to easily log and track metrics on your progress.”</em></p>  <h3>Application Features</h3>  <p><strong>Simple and easy to use     <br /></strong>I purposely built <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-in/app/simple-weight-log/e369e5bb-e363-4ada-a479-07ff60c85b6c">Simple Weight Log</a> to be extremely simple so it would be the easiest to use Weight Log application in the market.</p>  <p><strong>Data syncs across all your Windows 8 devices     <br /></strong>The app utilizes the built-in Roaming App Settings to automatically sync the data across all your Windows 8 devices using the Microsoft Account you log into your computer with.</p>  <p><strong>Graphs weight history to show metrics over time     <br /></strong>There is no better way to easily visualize weight changes over time, than to plot your weigh-ins on a graph.</p>  <h3>Why a Weight Log?</h3>  <p>I’m currently in the middle of a personal journey to loose weight and <a href="http://www.Beachbody.com/P90X">get in the best shape of my life</a>. In this journey I need to be able to graph my weigh-ins over time; so I built a Windows 8 app to do it. Not only did I write an app to use myself, but I published it to the Windows Store for FREE so anyone in the world can use it.</p>  <h3>Coming Updates to the App</h3>  <p>Even though the premise of the app is to remain extremely simple, I do plan on updating it to add more features over time. And, I’m not going to just think about what features to add all by myself. I have created a Feedback Forum over on UserVoice so anyone can suggest, vote for or comment on what features they think the app should have.</p>  <p>That’s right! I’m looking to my users for what cool, useful, awesome features to add to the app. There have already been a couple users suggest and vote on feature suggestions.</p>  <p><a href="https://simplovation.uservoice.com/forums/195544-simple-weight-log-for-windows-8">Have a feature suggestion for Simple Weight Log?</a></p>  <p>The link to this feedback forum is also located within the app so users can always have easy access to it.</p>  <h3>Conclusion</h3>  <p>In this first effort to build a Windows 8 app and get it published to the Windows Store; I have found the process to be very pleasant. As a result I plan on building more apps in the future.</p>  <p>In case you are wondering… Yes, the log entries in the screenshot are actual data I collected and entered into the app myself.</p>  <p>Ok, I encourage you to <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-in/app/simple-weight-log/e369e5bb-e363-4ada-a479-07ff60c85b6c">try the app out</a> and tell me what you think.</p>
