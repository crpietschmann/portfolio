<P>I just posted up the latest release (v1.1) of my windows service monitor app.</P>
<P><A href="/download/lunchtimecoder/dotNet/WindowsServiceMonitor/">Download LunchTimeCoder.ServiceMonitor&nbsp;v1.1</A></P>
<P>This is a small utility that monitors windows services running on the local machine or any maching on the local network. And notifies you via an icon in the system tray and a balloon popup telling you which services aren't running. You can also Start and Stop services from this utility.</P>
<P>New Features in this version:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Added ability to monitor services on any computer on the local network</LI>
<LI>The utility now remembers what services to monitor the next time it starts up</LI>
<LI>The services current state is now displayed next to its name</LI></UL>
<P>If you have any other suggestions for this little app, let me know. I've pretty much run out of any other feature ideas for this at the moment.</P>
<P>Hmm... What little app or component should I work on next?</P>
