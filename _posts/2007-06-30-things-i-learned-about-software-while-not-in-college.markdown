<OL>
<LI>If it works, don't monkey with it. You'll just break it and then have to rewrite it</LI>
<LI>Even though your main job is programming, you still have to deal with people. You may even have to deal with clients too.</LI>
<LI>There are times when purchasing a component is the best thing to do. You don't always have to reinvent the wheel.</LI>
<LI>Not all code is pretty, especially when fixing legacy code.</LI>
<LI>A college degree isn't as important as everyone thinks (at least in the software business); it doesn't mean you really know how to write code. It only means you know how to learn.</LI></OL>
