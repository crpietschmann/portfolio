<P>The <A href="http://dotnetkicks.com">DotNetKicks</A> site is 2 years old today. Way to go! <A href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/users/gavinjoyce">Gavin Joyce</A> started it, and now two years ago and alot of community contribution the site definately the place to find any resource you need on anything MS .NET related.</P>
<H3>What is DotNetKicks.com?</H3>
<P><A href="http://dotnetkicks.com">DotNetKicks.com</A> is a community based news site edited by our members. It specialises in .NET development techniques, technologies and tools including ASP.NET, C#, VB.NET, C++, Visual Studio, SubSonic, Open Source, SQL Server, Silverlight &amp; Mono. </P>
<P>Individual users of the site submit and review stories, the most popular of which make it to the homepage. Users are encouraged to 'kick' stories that they would like to appear on the homepage. If a story receives enough kicks, it will be promoted. </P>

<P>That right, <A href="http://code.google.com/p/dotnetkicks/">DotNetKicks is an open-source project</A>. You can take the code that runs DotNetKicks and create your own social news site.</P>
<H3>I've been using DotNetKicks for almost the entire 2 years</H3>
<P>I haven't setup my own site, but <A href="http://www.dotnetkicks.com/users/crpietschmann">I have been using DotNetKicks since March 2006</A>. So, I've been a contributor/user almost the entire time they've been live, and I'm not leaving the DotNetKicks community anytime soon.</P>
