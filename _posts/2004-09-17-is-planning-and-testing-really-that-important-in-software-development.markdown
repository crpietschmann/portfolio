<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Specifications documents need to be written out for all new features/enhancements, before any development begins.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>That way the developers have a blueprint to work with of how the feature/enhancement is to work. This should be written from the original description that is gotten from the client that is requesting it. Something that&#8217;s not too bad of an idea is to send this specs document to the client and have them approve it. Preferably the Specs document would also include a simple layout of how the user interface and any reports are desired to look.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Then when the developer gets these specs, they need to create something like a &#8220;plan of attack&#8221;, which is basically how they plan on implementing the feature/enhancement described in the Specs document. This &#8220;plan of attack&#8221; would include any database schema changes, DLL functions that already exist and new ones that need to be created, etc. that are necessary to implement this feature/enhancement. Preferably the &#8220;plan of attack&#8221; would be done by the developer that is going to code the feature/enhancement and at least one other developer, this way the best architectural decisions can be made.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Both of these documents should be saved and used for later reference (like: writing the&nbsp;product manual, fixing a bug, and TESTING to see that it works properly).<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Have you ever found a bug in a piece of software you were using? If so, what did you think about that that piece of software or the company that wrote the software? A user sees a bug, and says in their head, &#8220;This software sucks.&#8221; Do we want users thinking our software sucks?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Arial color=navy size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I don&#8217;t know exactly what percentage of bugs we miss and the clients find, but I think it&#8217;s something like 50%. That is a terrible number; we NEED to do more TESTING of things before they go live. At a job I used to have doing software testing (Time and Attendance/Payroll software) I was able to catch 70-90% of the bugs. The developer to Tester ratio their was 50% of Programming time was done Testing, if it took 8 hrs to program then there was 4 hrs spent testing. I tested every single part of the specs document pertaining to the feature/enhancement and related areas. I also tested inputting weird data into the application to make sure that it handled it correctly. When testing you need to test every single possibility of a setting, and as many possibilities of data as you can think of.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></FONT></P>
