Well, I didn't find a new bug, but it is the first time I discovered a bug in SQL Server by just doing my everyday job.

I'd post the code for the SQL Server user defined function that I wrote if I could, but I can't (confidential). Its nice to have a reminder once in awhile that even Microsoft's software has bugs.

```
Server: Msg 8624, Level 16, State 8, Line 1

Internal SQL Server error.
```
