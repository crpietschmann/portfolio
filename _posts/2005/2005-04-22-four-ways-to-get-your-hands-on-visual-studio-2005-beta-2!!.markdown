<LI>I posted a couple days ago that non-MSDN subscribers can get Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2 for FREE from <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/getthebetas/">http://msdn.microsoft.com/getthebetas/</A>. 
<LI>The <A title="MSDN Events" href="http://msdnevents.com/" target=_blank>MSDN Events</A> Resource DVD that will be given out at the Spring <A title="MSDN Events" href="http://msdnevents.com/" target=_blank>MSDN Events</A> will have Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2 on it. 
<LI>Of course, I can't forget, all MSDN Subscribers can download or order Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2. 
<LI>And finally if you live in Wisconsin; I heard a couple days ago that the <A title="Wisconsin .NET Users Group" href="http://wi-ineta.org/" target=_blank>WI-INETA</A> Executive Commitee is working with <A title=Microsoft href="http://microsoft.com/" target=_blank>Microsoft</A> to give out Beta 2 to all the attendees of the May 10th meeting. And they are planning on having a Code Fest for Beta 2 later in May. It's not set in stone yet, but the Code Fest may be 3-4 hours either on a weeknight or possibly a Saturday.</LI></OL>

I think it's awesome that Microsoft has been giving away Beta's of Visual Studio (Whidbey) 2005. If you haven't migrated from VC++, VB6 or any other language to <A title=.NET href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target=_blank>.NET</A> then you must check out the new features <A title=.NET href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target=_blank>.NET</A> 2.0 will be adding on top of what was in <A title=.NET href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target=_blank>.NET</A> 1.x.

As I have been saying for two years, since I first dove deep into <A title=.NET href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target=_blank>.NET</A>, I think this is the greatest development platform to come.
