I've been playing around the last couple of days with creating an application with a Plugin based architecture. It's alot easier with <a title=".NET" href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target="_blank">.NET</a> than it sounds. I don't have any examples or articles to post on here yet, but I'm working on something I hope to have up here in the next week or so.

On another note, the traffic of my site is using about 1GB of bandwidth per month now (consistantly the last two months). That's the most my site has ever used, I'm going to have to upgrade my hosting account soon. :) Apparently someone reads my blog.
