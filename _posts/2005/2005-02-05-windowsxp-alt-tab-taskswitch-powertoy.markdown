Now this is a feature that should have been added to <A title="Windows XP" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/default.mspx" target=_blank>Windows XP</A>. It matches and reflects the <A title="Windows XP" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/default.mspx" target=_blank>Windows XP</A> visual style. Its really neat because instead of just showing the title and icon of an application, it also shows a screenshot of the applications window. For instance, this is especially useful when switching between instances of Internet Explorer, since you can easily have 5 or more instances running at a time. Well, at least I do pretty frequently. This isn't something I just discovered, I've actually been using it since it was released.
