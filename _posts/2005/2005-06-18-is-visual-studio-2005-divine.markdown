<img src="/Blog/images/14/o_VS2005_Divine.jpg" alt="" align="left" />I started the installation of Visual Studio 2005 on my laptop, and then walked away to come back later and click Finish. When I came back I saw that the suns rays were shining down on my laptop. Is Visual Studio 2005 and <a title="Microsoft .NET Framework" href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target="_blank">.NET Framework</a> 2.0 the divine development platform?

This made me laugh; it's totally like in the movies when they have sun rays shine down on something they want to show as being &ldquo;divine&rdquo;.

Maybe this is a sign?  ;)
