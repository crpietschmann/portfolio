<P>Yes, I know there are tons of posts on other blogs that describe how to create a "successful" blog. Since, I've been bloging for over two years now, I thought I'd share some things that I've learned.</P>
<P>Below, in the order they came to mind, are some tips for building a successful blog:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Make sure you have an RSS feed. This one is crucial, otherwise how would people subscribe?</LI>
<LI>Pick a main theme to center your blog posts around.&nbsp;For instance my blog centers around .NET and web development.</LI>
<LI>You can stray from your main theme but try to keep it to a minimum. You don't want to loose your readers interest and make them unsubscribe.</LI>
<LI>Use as many keywords as you can in your blog post title and content. This will help you show up in search engines. </LI>
<LI>Place the Title of you blog post (not your blog)&nbsp;in the page title when displaying a single post. This will help you show up in search engines.</LI>
<LI>Don't require visitors to login in order to post comments. You want to encourage comments as much as possible.</LI>
<LI>Use banner ads tastefully but make sure they are visible so visitors click on them. Don't take up too much page&nbsp;real estate or make them annoying.</LI>
<LI>Buy a domain name to host your blog at so you have control over everything and this will help with search engines. Try to find a domain name that is related to what you'll blog about.</LI>
<LI>Don't be afraid to link to other blog posts or sites.</LI>
<LI>When you post comments on other blogs make sure you enter in the url to your blog. This is an easy way to get links to your site.</LI>
<LI>Setup your blog url as your blog/website url or signature on forums you participate. This is another way to easily get links to your site.</LI>
<LI>Try to find things to blog about that others aren't blogging about as much. Fill in a gap. This will help you come up higher in search engines since your post might be one of only a few about that particular item.</LI>
<LI>Make sure you have a contact form on your site so visitors can email you.</LI>
<LI>Always try to reply to any comments/questions that your visitors/subscribers send you.</LI>
<LI>Post regularly but not too often. If you don't post enough visitors wont subscribe and if you post to often visitors wont read all your posts.</LI></UL>
<P>How do you know your blog is "successful"? Well, for one the fact that you can actually maintain a few subscribed readers.</P>
<P>Why do I think my blog is "successful"? Well, maybe I think higher of my blog than it actually is, but what I'm doing seems to be working.</P>
<P>Here's a list of some cool features that I've seen on other blogs or have thought about adding to my own:</P>
<UL>
<LI>An OPML feed of your Blog Roll. This allows your visitors to easily import your blog roll into their favorite RSS reader. (this one I currently have implemented)</LI>
<LI>Add the ability for visitors/subscribers to rate/rank your posts. This will allow you to know if they're satisfied with your content.</LI>
<LI>Use Tagging to categorize your posts.</LI>
<LI>Add a view count to your posts so you can see which ones visitors are looking at.</LI>
<LI>Add a "Recently Viewed" list so visitors can see what posts other visitors are viewing.</LI></UL>
