Just as finding yourself worth internally is important, so is taking care of yourself first. Our society tends to push the idea that prioritizing yourself above others as being selfish and bad. However, being selfish isn't always a bad thing. Being selfish is often bad if it negatively affects others, but there are appropriate times to be selfish where it's a good thing. A time where selfishness is good is when you are taking care of yourself.

You need to care for yourself before you can care for other things. This includes doing things that help with your own physical and mental health. Activities included in this are eating, sleeping, meditating, exercising, and even getting some relaxation in to keep yourself centered.

It's too easy to fall into the trap of putting work and family first, but if you are then you aren't. If you put other things in front of your own well being, then those aren't being put first anyway. You can't take care of others, work, or anything else properly if you don't take care of yourself.

Care for yourself first. Heal both physically and mentally first. If you aren't healthy (both physically and mentally) then you wont be able to affectively take care of all the other priorities you have in life. After all, you can't take care of family or work if you're dead.
