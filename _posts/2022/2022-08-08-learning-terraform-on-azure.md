The last few years I've been working a lot with using HashiCorp Terraform to build resource managed and creation pipelines for managing Microsoft Azure environments. The native tools to Microsoft Azure for building Infrastructure as Code (IaC) are ARM Templates and Azure Bicep, which I've also worked a lot with over the years, but HashiCorp Terraform is the popular IaC tooling that is platform agnostic. This means you can use Terraform to manage infrastructure resources in Microsoft Azure as well as other non-Microsoft platforms all from a single IaC project. It's a great tool, and is still growing in popularity as more and more organizations adopt DevOps and SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) practices.

The last couple years I've worked a bit at writing articles over on Build5Nines.com around several topics to help others learn how to use and get more proficient with [HashiCorp Terraform](https://build5nines.com/category/terraform/). In helping the community around learning and using Terraform, I was even awarded a [HashiCorp Ambassador](https://build5nines.com/what-is-the-hashicorp-ambassador-award/) in 2021 for the content and community help that I provided in my spare time. I am also a [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate](https://build5nines.com/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-devops-certification/) too.

In case you're looking to get started with Terraform, or just get more proficient with it, here are several of the Terrafrom related articles that I've written so far:

- [Get Started with Terraform on Azure](https://build5nines.com/get-started-with-terraform-on-microsoft-azure/)
- [Terraform: Overview of Azure Providers and Tools](https://build5nines.com/terraform-overview-of-azure-providers-and-tools/)
- [Use Terraform Input Variables to Parameterize Infrastructure Deployments](https://build5nines.com/use-terraform-input-variables-to-parameterize-infrastructure-deployments/)
- [Terraform: If/Else Conditional Resource and Module Deployment](https://build5nines.com/terraform-if-else-conditional-resource-and-module-deployment/)
- [Terraform Modules: Create Reusable Infrastructure as Code](https://build5nines.com/terraform-modules-create-reusable-infrastructure-as-code/)
- [Terraform Feature Flags & Environment Toggle Design Patterns](https://build5nines.com/terraform-feature-flags-environment-toggle-design-patterns/)
- [Terraform: Azure Resource Tags Tips](https://build5nines.com/terraform-azure-resource-tags-tips/)
- [Terraform: Deploy to Multiple Azure Subscriptions in Single Project](https://build5nines.com/terraform-deploy-to-multiple-azure-subscriptions-in-single-project/)
- [Comparison: Terraform vs Azure Bicep](https://build5nines.com/comparison-terraform-vs-azure-bicep/)

I hope these help you on your journey to learning Terraform, using it with Azure and other platforms, and further developing your DevOps and/or SRE toolset. I'm still working on writing more [Terraform and Azure content](https://build5nines.com/category/terraform/) on a regular basis over on Build5Nines.com. I recommend you head over there to check it out!
