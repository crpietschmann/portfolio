I know 802.11b and g both use 2.4Ghz frequency range, which is the same as a Microwave Oven. Now the question is, could you basically turn up the power on your router to the point that it would be able to cook food?

I know technically (if this were possible) the components inside the router aren't made to withstand handling that much power. But, what if?

Microwave = Cooked Food

WiFi + Power = Cooked Food????
