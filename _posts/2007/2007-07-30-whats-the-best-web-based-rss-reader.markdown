Calling all subscribers... What RSS readers do you use?

I am looking for a really good web-based RSS reader to use. I haven't found one that I really like yet, and am thinking about just writing my own. But, first, I thought I would call out to see what YOU are using.

Please post a comment with the name/url to the RSS reader you use or have used. Also, if you could please state which features you like or dislike.

Thank you very much for your help!
