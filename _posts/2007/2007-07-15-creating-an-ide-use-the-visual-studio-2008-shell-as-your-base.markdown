Starting with Visual Studio 2008, you'll be able to use the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb510103.aspx">Visual Studio 2008 Shell</a> as the starting point to create your own development tools. The Visual Studio Shell will be available as part of the Visual Studio 2008 SDK, but I believe we'll have to wait until VS'08 RTM's before we'll be able to play with creating apps using the shell. On the Visual Studio 2008 Shell page, there's a screenshot of <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/bb510103.aspx">Floorplan designer built using the VS'08 Shell</a>.

This looks like a really neat feature that'll allow a much quicker development of tools that can utilize the VS Shell as their base.

I guess this'll bring a new meaning to "all your base are belong to us".  :)
