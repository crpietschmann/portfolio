**Update Dec. 11, 2007: **The <a href="/Blog/Post.aspx?PostID=1431">WI .NET Users Group Holiday Party has been cancelled due to weather</a>, and will be rescheduled.

On Dec. 11, 2007, <a href="http://www.wi-ineta.org/holiday">Microsoft is teaming up with the Wisconsin .NET Users Group</a> to throw a special holiday part. There will be Free food and prizes, just like at every other group meeting.

Do you want to get Visual Studio 2008 Free? Just bring in your computer and install it at the party. Those that install VS'08 at the party will get a full licensed copy of Visual Studio 2008 mailed to them within a couple weeks. This is so awesome; I know I'll be bringing my laptop! I wonder how many people who don't have laptops will be bringing in their desktops? C'mon don't be shy...

The full details of the party have yet to be announced, but make sure you <a href="http://www.wi-ineta.org/holiday">go register for the meeting</a>. And, remember membership to the Wisconsin .NET Users Group is Free!
