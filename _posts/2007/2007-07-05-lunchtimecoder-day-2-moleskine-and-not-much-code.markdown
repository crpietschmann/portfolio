I went out at lunch today and purchased a <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moleskine">Moleskine</A> (well, the one I got isn't made by the <A href="http://www.moleskine.com/">Moleskine company</A>, but it's still a pocket sized, hard cover notebook), and a nice 0.5mm fine point pen. I've already read some of the <A href="http://lifehacker.com/software/moleskine/">"hacks" for Moleskine's</A>, and pondered getting one for a few months. I even tried folding a piece of 8.5"x11" paper so it was like a pocket sized book, but that didn't last long due to the vulnarability of paper.

My use of it is going to basically be a "poor mans" PDA. Maybe if I use this enough, I'll get a Pocket PC at some point, but I don't know since this doesn't require any power.

My stats are now 1:1. It's only the second day of the Lunch Time Code, and I've already gone a day without coding.
