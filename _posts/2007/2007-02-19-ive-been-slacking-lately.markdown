<!-- more -->

Basically, I haven't been working on much in my spare time lately.

A week and a half ago, my wife and I got back from spending a week in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. We went to an all inclusive resort and everything was very relaxing. Neither of us had ever flown, so this was a whole new experience for both.

Well, it basically took a week to get back in the flow of things after being in paradise for a week. And, now that I'm back in the flow, I'll be continuing work on all my side projects.
