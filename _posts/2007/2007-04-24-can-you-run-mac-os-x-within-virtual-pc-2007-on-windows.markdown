Does anyone know if Mac OS X can be run within Virtual PC 2007 under Windows?

I've searched and can't find any evidence of this being possible. I am thinking about possibly doing this because I would like to do some software testing on Mac OS X, and I would rather spend less for just the OS than buy a Mac Mini.

Mac OS X - $129.00<BR>Mac Mini - $599.00

If anyone has any clues please let me know.

**Update 5/22/2007:<BR>**The day I originally posted this, I also contacted Ben Armstrong, through his blog (<A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/default.aspx">Virtual PC Guy</A>), and asked hime if this is possible with Virtual PC 2007. Here's the reply I got from him:
<P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Consolas>This is not possible for three reasons:</FONT>
<P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Consolas><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">        </SPAN>1) Apple does not allow this in their OS licensing</FONT>
<P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Consolas><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">        </SPAN>2) Mac OS X specifically checks to ensure that it is installing on Apple hardware</FONT>
<P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT face=Consolas><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">        </SPAN>3) Mac OS X requires that the computer has an APIC - which we do not emulate</FONT>

<P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"> 
<P class=MsoPlainText style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">There we go, a definate answer of No. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to look for another solution. I think I remember reading somewhere that VMWare supports it...

If I find out more into, I'll post it here.
