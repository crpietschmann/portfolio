<!-- more -->

My RSS feed url has changed to the following:

<A href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/crpietschmann">http://feeds.feedburner.com/crpietschmann</A>

The old url will still be active for awhile still, but I will be setting it to redirect to the new one shortly. So, please update your reference to my feed in your reader.

Until now, I have been using a small, hidden 1 pixel image to track the views of my posts through my feed. I have been able to tell that I may have approximately 50 subscribers, but I'm not completely sure. This is why I have decided to move the feed over to FeedBurner so I can more accurately tell how many subscribers I actually have.

It's always nice to know that I'm not just talking to myself here. Thanks for subscribing!
