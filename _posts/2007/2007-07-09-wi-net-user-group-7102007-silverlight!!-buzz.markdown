In a nearly last minute announcement, I recieved the usual Wisconsin .NET Users Group meeting announcement email late list night (although I didn't see it until this morning.) <a href="http://wi-ineta.org">This months meeting (July 10th) is on Silverlight (*buzz, buzz buzz...*). </a>As the <a href="http://wi-ineta.org">WI .NET UG site </a>states "*Silverlight is the topic, but the rest of the details are coming soon*"; so I don't know who's going to talk or what exactly about but I do hear a loud "*BUZZ*".

If you're interested in attending (and it's completely free) go check out the <a href="http://wi-ineta.org">Wisconsin .NET User Groups site </a>at <a href="http://wi-ineta.org">http://wi-ineta.org</a>

See you there and let the buzz words fly...

buzz... buzz... SILVERLIGHT... buzz... buzz...
