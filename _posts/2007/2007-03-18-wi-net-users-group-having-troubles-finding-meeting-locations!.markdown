The turn out for each of the <a href="http://wi-ineta.org">Wisconsin .NET Users Group</a> meetings is really great. So great, there are regularly 100+ attendees. The reason for such great attendance can be attributed to two things:

<ol>
	<li>The presenters (mostly local talent) consistently perform really awesome, informative and educational presentations.</li>
	<li>There is a pretty large .NET community in the Milwaukee area</li>
</ol>


I&#39;ve been a member of the group since 2003 and attend the meetings very regularly. I&#39;ve also never been dissappointed with their quality and alway leave wanting to learn more!



As it turns out the <a href="http://wi-ineta.org">Wisconsin .NET Users Group</a> is having trouble finding meeting locations that can accommodate 100+ persons. If you are a local company, in the Milwaukee area, that has a meeting room with a capacity of 100+, please think about sponsoring a meeting or two. If you are a member of the group, please think about either donating money or talking to your employer about sponsoring the users group.



Here&#39;s a list of some of the topics discussed at <a href="http://wi-ineta.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=58">recent meetings</a>:

<ul>
	<li>Feb. 2007 - ASP.NET AJAX</li>
	<li>Jan. 2007 - LINQ and ADO.NET vNext</li>
	<li>Nov. 2006 - Overview of Web 2.0</li>
	<li>Oct. 2006 - Rapid Web Development with .NET</li>
	<li>Sept. 2006 - Windows Workflow Foundation</li>
	<li>Aug. 2006 - Ignore the Man Behind the Curtain - The ASP.NET Pipeline</li>
	<li>Jul. 2006 - Introduction to Grid Computing</li>
</ul>


The <a href="http://wi-ineta.org">Wisconin .NET Users Group</a> really shows there is a great developer community in the Milwaukee area! And, I sure you agree when I say &quot;I don&#39;t want to see it dissapear!&quot;
