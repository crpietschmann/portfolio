Here&#39;s&nbsp;links to&nbsp;some excellent resources&nbsp;for MS&nbsp;Virtual Earth development: 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://garzilla.net/vemaps/">Virtual Earth Concepts by Mike Garza</a><br />
These are some excellent concept examples&nbsp;for building rich user experiences with Virtual Earth. Some of the examples include: Draggable Shapes/Pushpins,&nbsp; Select plotted Shapes using a Selection Box, and Sidebar listing plotted Shapes that highlights the Shape on the map when hovered over. Today he just posted two new examples of adding Drag Handles to Polygons and Polylines to allow the user to easily move/resize the shapes using the Mouse. These are some really excellent example! 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://viavirtualearth.com">ViaVirtualEarth</a> and <a href="http://www.viawindowslive.com/VirtualEarth.aspx">ViaWindowsLive</a><br />
Both of these sites are run by the same guys, but both contains some really excellent articles. I don&#39;t know if they are still updating ViaVirtualEarth, I believe ViaWindowsLive was created as a replacement. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://dev.live.com/virtualearth/sdk">Virtual Earth Interactive SDK</a><br />
This is the official interactive SDK for Virtual Earth. I should need to list this since everyone probably already knows about it, but it&#39;s such a great resourec I can&#39;t leave it out.
