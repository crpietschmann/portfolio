I never worked with regular expressions before. I heard how great they can be, but never really knew. Regular expressions are really cool.

RegEx Sample: Number with 0 to 3 decimal places:

```
(|\-)\d+(.\d{3}|.\d{2}|.\d{1}|)
```

Regular expressions look pretty complex and sort of cryptic at first glance, but if you have a good tutorial to go through it one part at time they aren't really difficult to learn how to write.

This site has some good tutorials on Regular Expressions: <A href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorialcnt.html">http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorialcnt.html</A>

Happy RegEx-ing!!
