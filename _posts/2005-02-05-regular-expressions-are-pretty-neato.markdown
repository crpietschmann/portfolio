<P>I never worked with regular expressions before. I heard how great they can be, but never really knew. Regular expressions are really cool.</P>
<P>RegEx Sample: Number with 0 to 3 decimal places&nbsp; <FONT color=#0000ff>(|\-)\d+(.\d{3}|.\d{2}|.\d{1}|)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Regular expressions look pretty complex and sort of cryptic at first glance, but if you have a good tutorial to go through it one part at time they aren't really difficult to learn how to write.</FONT></P>
<P>This site has some good tutorials on Regular Expressions: <A href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorialcnt.html">http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorialcnt.html</A></P>
<P>Happy RegEx-ing!!</P>
