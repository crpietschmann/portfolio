<p>The Apple iPhone has been confirmed. I wasn't anticipating much for this thing, but it sure looks sweet. There are no keys, you just touch the screen. There seems to be alot of posibilities with this. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/the-apple-iphone/">The iPhone also runs Mac OS X.</a></p>
<p>Here are some links to images of the iPhone:<br /><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/the-apple-iphone/">http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/the-apple-iphone/</a><br /><a href="http://codinghub.com/iphone.html">http://codinghub.com/iphone.html</a><br /><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/beausf/351847182/in/photostream/">http://flickr.com/photos/beausf/351847182/in/photostream/</a></p>
<p>I wonder what kind of development tools/options they will have available for the iPhone. Since it isn't from Microsoft, it wont have the .NET Compact Framework; which is too bad since .NET is so awesome. But, I'm sure Mono will run on it&nbsp;since it runs Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Lets step back and think about this product; is it truly innovative? umm.... No it is not! The iPhone is rather similar to&nbsp;a MS Windows Mobile Phone with the exception&nbsp;of the large touch screen with no hard keys.&nbsp;Really, when you get down to it they are both just&nbsp;mobile phones with PC functionality&nbsp;that can fit in your pocket.</p>
<p>This thing certainly intrigues me, but I don't believe I'll be purchasing one anytime soon. Besides it only works with Cingular and my cell provider is US Cellular.</p>
