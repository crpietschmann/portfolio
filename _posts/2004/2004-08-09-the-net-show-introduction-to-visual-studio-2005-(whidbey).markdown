I watch the latest episode of the .NET Show today. All I can say is just awesome. The <a title="ASP.NET" href="http://asp.net" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a> team set and succeeded at their goal of reducing the amount of code you have to write by 70%!! Check this video out and see the new features of VS2K5. They are also building in the ability to do unit tests. I'm not going to explain everything here, just go watch the episode and see for yourself.
