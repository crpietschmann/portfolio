Today, I started creating my own implementation of the VB.NET 2005 &ldquo;My&ldquo; namespace. The target platforms for my implementation are .NET v1.1 and <a href="http://mono-project.com" target="_blank" title="Mono Project">Mono</a> v1.x  Heck, maybe eventually I could convince the folks over at the Mono project to put my code into their implementation of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target="_blank" title="Microsoft .NET Framework">.NET Framework</a>, but I suppose I&#39;ll have to get alot more done on it first.

If you don&#39;t know what the &ldquo;My&rdquo; namespace is check this out: <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=13368">http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=13368</a>

If you would like to get your hands on my implementation of the `My` namespace for .NET 1.1 and Mono, you will have to wait since it is no where near complete enough to even let anyone play with it.

> *UPDATE: I have since abandoned this project idea since the `My` namespace is WAY to large for one person to write the entire thing in their spare time. Plus, I think the Mono guys have probably started to tackle this anyway.*
