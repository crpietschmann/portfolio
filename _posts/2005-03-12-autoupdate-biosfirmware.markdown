<P>I was talking to one of my friends and he mentioned a conversation he had with someone about AutoUpdating Firmware/BIOS in the background while you are using your computer. The person my friend was talking about seems to think that his <a title="WinXP" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/default.mspx" target="_blank">WinXP</a>&nbsp;system at home currently does this. He must be thinking that Windows Update does a little more than update Windows. Even though this isn't something that is or can be done now; it got me thinking.</P>
<P>Automatically updating your BIOS or other Firmware would be a pretty neet thing, but also a very risky thing. What happens when I want to turn my computer off but its in the middle of a BIOS update? Or how about a power outage in the middle?</P>
<P>After thinking about it; I wouldn't want my computer automatically updating the BIOS for me when ever theres an update available. I've had my laptop for a year and my desktop for two years; I've never updated the BIOS on them and I don't believe I ever will.</P>
<P>With current computer hardware, It's definitely a feature that I wouldn't turn on if given an option. Maybe someday BIOS/Firmware AutoUpdate will be a reality, but not today.</P>
