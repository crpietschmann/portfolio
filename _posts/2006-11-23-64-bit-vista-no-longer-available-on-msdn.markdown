<P>Apparently I downloaded the 64-bit version of Vista at a good time. They have since removed it from the list&nbsp;in MSDN subscriber downloads. I wonder why they removed it?</P>
<P><STRONG>Update 12/11/2006:</STRONG> I don't know exactly when they put it back up, but Vista x64 is back up on MSDN Downloads.</P>
