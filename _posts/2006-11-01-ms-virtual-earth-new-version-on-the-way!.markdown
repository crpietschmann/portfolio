Microsoft announced yesterday that they will be releasing a new version of the Virtual Earth Map Control next week on Nov. 7. They are stating that existing sites using versions 2 and 3 will not be impacted and will continue to work. They also mention an upcoming marketing campaign surrounding this next release.



Could this new version be v4?<br />
What cool new features will they be adding?
