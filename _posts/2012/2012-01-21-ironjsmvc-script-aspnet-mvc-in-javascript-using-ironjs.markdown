Personally, I enjoy writing much of my applications using a statically typed language such as C#. However, I would really prefer to be able to write UI logic and script certain parts of my applications using a dynamic language if I could. I was thinking about this and the following question came to mind:  
*What would it be like to write an ASP.NET MVC application entirely using JavaScript?*  
So I thought I’d work up a prototype using <a href="https://github.com/fholm/IronJS/">IronJS</a> (a javascript implementation for the .NET DLR.)  
Download IronJSMVC prototype source code here:

Here’s a screenshot of the prototype code running, also showing a sample Controller and View written entirely in JavaScript:

I was just looking at the source code for IronJSMVC that I posted on github last September and I realized that I never posted about it here.
