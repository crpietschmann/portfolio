<li> Microsoft CDN (Content Delivery Network) Support Added. This helps improve the Bing Maps content delivery speed by up to 82%</li>
<li>JavaScript Performance Optimizations. All the JavaScript code internally within the control has been optimized to increase the overall speed of the Web.Maps.VE Map controls functionality.</li>

<p>Also, this new version release is a completely FREE upgrade to all existing customers who have already purchased Web.Maps.VE v2.0.
