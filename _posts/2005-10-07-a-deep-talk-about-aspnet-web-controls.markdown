<p>This is another great episode of The <a title=".NET" href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/" target="_blank">.NET</a> Rocks show. This weeks episode is all about writing Web Controls in <a title="ASP.NET" href="http://asp.net" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a>. I think this is one of the more advanced topics they've covered on the show. I listened to it a couple times and since I don't author too many user controls, I think I'll have to play with more of the stuff they discuss.</p>
<p><span id="ShowLatest1_lblDescription"><em><span id="ShowLatest1_lblTitle" style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; COLOR: #2c5c9d">Miguel Castro on Web Controls<br /></span>Carl and Richard run into Miguel Castro at a hotel bar at the MVP Summit 2005 in Bellevue, WA. This is the first real show we've done on Web Controls, and it has been a long time coming. There is so much technical information in this show you'll have to listen several times at possibly a slower speed.</em></span></p>
