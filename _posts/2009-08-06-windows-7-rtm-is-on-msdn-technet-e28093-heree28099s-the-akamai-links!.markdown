<p>I first started downloading Windows 7 Ultimate off MSDN using the old File Transfer Manager and it was taking FOREVER to download. The download started out good, then it dropped off to about 40KB/sec and said it would take about 14 hours to finish! Man, I was hoping I’d be able to get it downloaded quick so I can start updating my machines today/tonight.</p>  <p>Then I saw a Twitter post by <a href="http://twitter.com/Rickster_CDN" target="_blank">@Rickster_CDN</a> mentioning a link to a page with the AKAMAI links for TechNet to download Windows 7 WAY FASTER! Actually the link is to the “Top Downloads” page on TechNet.</p>  <p>It turns out that MSDN has the same kind of “Top Downloads” page, so&#160; you can really use AKAMAI to download Windows 7 much FASTER whether you have an MSDN or TechNet Subscription.</p>  <p>Here’s the Links:</p>  <p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/securedownloads/dd692862.aspx" target="_blank">TechNet Top Downloads with AKAMAI Links</a></p>  <p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/securedownloads/bb608344.aspx" target="_blank">MSDN Top Downloads with AKAMAI Links</a></p>  <p>I’m currently downloading Windows 7 Ultimate RTM at about 1.3MB/sec and I have about 28 minutes left. It sure beat the crap out of the File Transfer Manager downloading at about 40KB/sec.</p>  <p>Happy Downloading!</p>
