<div class="container">
My name is Chris Pietschmann. I do so many things, it's difficult to describe myself in just a single sentence. So here's a few:

I'm a husband, father of 2 wonderful children, Founder of [Build Azure LLC](https://buildazure.com), Owner of [Simplovation LLC](http://simplovation.com), Microsoft MVP, Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect, and I am also engaged in a journey of continuous education, of which I enjoy sharing what I learn with others. I hope to teach, be taught, and inspire others. Also, I recently started new blogs over at <http://buildazure.com> dedicated to sharing information and tutorials on Microsoft Azure development. I am also a Founder of the [Milwaukee Azure meetup group](http://mkeazure.com).

A mantra I live by is: "Work Smart, Not Hard"

The pietschsoft.com domain name has been my internet presence hub since 2003, and I've been blogging here since 2004.

## Background

I'm a technology enthusiast. I have been using computers since 1984 (at age 3) and have been programming them since 1996 (age 14.) My first programming language was QBasic. I've always had an interest in giving back to the online development community and as a result I have been awarded the Microsoft MVP award multiple times; and am a current Microsoft MVP in Azure and IoT technologies.

I am always dedicated to helping out the software development community. Evidence of this can be seen in the traces of my online community activity from my blogs, Open Source projects, my Stack Overflow profile, and much, much more!
