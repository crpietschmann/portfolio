        <title>Top Terraform and Azure Articles on Build5Nines in 2022 (plus year in review)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to write up summary posts about the traffic of &lt;a href=&quot;https://build5nines.com&quot;&gt;Build5Nines.com&lt;/a&gt; over on Build5nines.com. It’s been a few years since I did a write up of the annual traffic over there, so I decided to write up a simplified version of the old “Build5Nines.com year in review” style posts for 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is ChatGPT and is it important?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT seems to be the buzz and is talked about everywhere across social media today. Specifically, ChatGPT that is a variant of GPT-3 language model that provides an artificial intelligence (AI) chat bot. People are using it to write college essays, programming code, and many other things. I decided to take a look at it, try it out, and ask it some questions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Always Focus on What Matters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So often in life we get distracted. These distractions can come in many forms. Sometimes things happen that distract our attention unnecessarily, like friends / family wanting our attention or something breaks that needs attention. Other times, we distract ourselves since we don’t want to deal with the realities of life. What ever the distraction is, it’s important to not allow it to pull your focus away from the important things for too long. Sure, there are times when we a distraction is welcome, but it mustn’t be allowed to persist for too long.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Work Authoring Microsoft Cloud Workshops</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, I’ve been involved with writing content for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://microsoftcloudworkshop.com&quot;&gt;Microsoft Cloud Workshops&lt;/a&gt; (MCWs). These contain design sessions and hands-on lab training content that Microsoft uses to train their own Cloud Solution Architects (CSAs) and even used when working with customers to teach more about deploying advanced Microsoft Azure workloads in the cloud. I have authored new MCWs myself, as well as worked to help update and maintain many of the existing MCWs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google Ranks Active Blogs Higher is Search Results</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I figured out recently that Google does factor in how active your site or blog is when ranking content in the search results. In the SEO world, there’s a ton of recommendations on keyword research and how to write the perfect articles. However, what no body talks about is whether a blog or website being active in publishing new content has an affect on the traffic that will be sent to it by Google through organic searches. I found out recently with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://Build5Nines.com&quot;&gt;https://Build5Nines.com&lt;/a&gt; website that Google does take into account how active your website is in how it will rank that websites content in search.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>JavaScript: Remove Specific Items from Array</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When writing JavaScript code, there are many use cases where working with Arrays is required. Creating arrays of values / object and receiving them from API calls is really common. &lt;a href=&quot;/post/2020/07/01/loop-through-javascript-arrays-using-for-forEach-map-functions&quot;&gt;Looping through JavaScript Arrays&lt;/a&gt; is a common action to perform, but removing items from a JavaScript Array you are working with is not as straight forward. In this article, we’ll take a look at some methods that can be performed to allow you to make sense of removing items from an array.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you trying to build a successful blog for promoting or building a consulting business? Blogging can be a great way to promote yourself, your brand, your products or services. However, it takes more than just writing blog articles and creating more pages to pop up on Google searches. You need to write a blog that people will actually want to read and follow. But how do you do this to help grow a consulting business?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Care for Yourself First</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as finding yourself worth internally is important, so is taking care of yourself first. Our society tends to push the idea that prioritizing yourself above others as being selfish and bad. However, being selfish isn’t always a bad thing. Being selfish is often bad if it negatively affects others, but there are appropriate times to be selfish where it’s a good thing. A time where selfishness is good is when you are taking care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
